  <introduction>
    <p>
      Chapter<nbsp/><xref ref="ch-foundations-for-inference"/> introduced a framework for 
      statistical inference based on confidence intervals and hypotheses using the normal 
      distribution for sample proportions. In this chapter, we encounter several new point 
      estimates and a couple new distributions. In each case, the inference ideas remain the 
      same: determine which point estimate or test statistic is useful, identify an appropriate 
      distribution for the point estimate or test statistic, and apply the ideas of inference.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Similar to how we can model the behavior of the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> using
        a normal distribution, the sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m> can also be modeled using a normal
        distribution when certain conditions are met. However, we'll soon learn that a new
        distribution, called the <m>t</m>-distribution, tends to be more useful when working with
        the sample mean. We'll first learn about this new distribution, then we'll use it to
        construct confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests for the mean.

      <p>
        The sample mean tends to follow a normal distribution centered at the population mean, <m>\mu</m>,
        when certain conditions are met. Additionally, we can compute a standard error for the sample
        mean using the population standard deviation <m>\sigma</m> and the sample size <m>n</m>.

            When we collect a sufficiently large sample of <m>n</m> independent observations from a

      </theorem>
      
      <p>
        Before diving into confidence intervals and hypothesis tests using <m>\bar{x}</m>, we first
        need to cover two topics:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            When we modeled <m>\hat{p}</m> using the normal distribution, certain conditions had to be
            satisfied. The conditions for working with <m>\bar{x}</m> are a little more complex, and
            we'll spend Section<nbsp/><xref ref="x_bar_conditions"/> discussing how to check conditions
            for inference.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The standard error is dependent on the population standard deviation, <m>\sigma</m>. However,
            we rarely know <m>\sigma</m>, and instead we must estimate it. Because this estimation is
            itself imperfect, we use a new distribution called the <m>t</m>-distribution to fix this
            problem, which we discuss in Section<nbsp/><xref ref="introducingTheTDistribution"/>.

    <subsection xml:id="x_bar_conditions">
      <title>Evaluating the two conditions required for modeling <m>\bar{x}</m></title>
      
      <p>
        Two conditions are required to apply the Central Limit Theorem for a sample mean <m>\bar{x}</m>:
      </p>
      
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Independence.</title>
          <p>
            The sample observations must be independent. The most common way to satisfy this condition
            is when the sample is a simple random sample from the population. If the data come from a
            random process, analogous to rolling a die, this would also satisfy the independence condition.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Normality.</title>
          <p>
            When a sample is small, we also require that the sample observations come from a normally
            distributed population. We can relax this condition more and more for larger and larger
            sample sizes. This condition is obviously vague, making it difficult to evaluate, so next
            we introduce a couple rules of thumb to make checking this condition easier.
          </p>
        </li>
      </dl>
      
      <assemblage xml:id="normality-rules-thumb">
        <title>Rules of thumb: how to perform the normality check</title>
        <p>
          There is no perfect way to check the normality condition, so instead we use two rules of thumb:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title><m>n \lt 30</m>:</title>
            <p>
              If the sample size <m>n</m> is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data,
              then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the
              condition.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title><m>n \geq 30</m>:</title>
            <p>
              If the sample size <m>n</m> is at least 30 and there are no <em>particularly extreme</em>
              outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}</m> is nearly
              normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.
            </p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </assemblage>
      
      <p>
        In this first course in statistics, you aren't expected to develop perfect judgement on the
        normality condition. However, you are expected to be able to handle clear cut cases based on
        the rules of thumb.<fn>More nuanced guidelines would consider further relaxing the
        <em>particularly extreme outlier</em> check when the sample size is very large. However, we'll
        leave further discussion here to a future course.</fn>

      <example xml:id="outliers_and_ss_condition_ex">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider the following two plots that come from simple random samples from different
            populations. Their sample sizes are <m>n_1 = 15</m> and <m>n_2 = 50</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            [Figure showing two histograms: Sample 1 Observations (n=15) with values 0-7, and Sample 2
            Observations (n=50) with values 0-22 with most data near zero and one outlier at 21-22]
          </p>
          <p>
            Are the independence and normality conditions met in each case?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Each sample is from a simple random sample of its respective population, so the independence
            condition is satisfied. Let's next check the normality condition for each using the rule of thumb.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first sample has fewer than 30 observations, so we are watching for any clear outliers.
            None are present; while there is a small gap in the histogram between 5 and 6, this gap is
            small and 20% of the observations in this small sample are represented in that far right bar
            of the histogram, so we can hardly call these clear outliers. With no clear outliers, the
            normality condition is reasonably met.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second sample has a sample size greater than 30 and includes an outlier that appears to
            be roughly 5 times further from the center of the distribution than the next furthest
            observation. This is an example of a particularly extreme outlier, so the normality condition
            would not be satisfied.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      
      <p>
        In practice, it's typical to also do a mental check to evaluate whether we have reason to believe
        the underlying population would have moderate skew (if <m>n \lt 30</m>) or have particularly
        extreme outliers (<m>n \geq 30</m>) beyond what we observe in the data. For example, consider
        the number of followers for each individual account on Twitter, and then imagine this distribution.
        The large majority of accounts have built up a couple thousand followers or fewer, while a
        relatively tiny fraction have amassed tens of millions of followers, meaning the distribution is
        extremely skewed. When we know the data come from such an extremely skewed distribution, it takes
        some effort to understand what sample size is large enough for the normality condition to be
        satisfied.

    <subsection xml:id="introducingTheTDistribution">
      <title>Introducing the <m>t</m>-distribution</title>
      
      <p>
        In practice, we cannot directly calculate the standard error for <m>\bar{x}</m> since we do not
        know the population standard deviation, <m>\sigma</m>. We encountered a similar issue when
        computing the standard error for a sample proportion, which relied on the population proportion,
        <m>p</m>. Our solution in the proportion context was to use the sample value in place of the
        population value when computing the standard error. We'll employ a similar strategy for computing
        the standard error of <m>\bar{x}</m>, using the sample standard deviation <m>s</m> in place of
        <m>\sigma</m>:
      </p>
      <me>
        SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \approx \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
      </me>
      <p>
        This strategy tends to work well when we have a lot of data and can estimate <m>\sigma</m> using
        <m>s</m> accurately. However, the estimate is less precise with smaller samples, and this leads
        to problems when using the normal distribution to model <m>\bar{x}</m>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We'll find it useful to use a new distribution for inference calculations called the
        <term><m>t</m>-distribution</term>. A <m>t</m>-distribution, shown as a solid line in
        Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="tDistCompareToNormalDist"/>, has a bell shape. However, its tails are
        thicker than the normal distribution's, meaning observations are more likely to fall beyond two
        standard deviations from the mean than under the normal distribution. The extra thick tails of
        the <m>t</m>-distribution are exactly the correction needed to resolve the problem of using
        <m>s</m> in place of <m>\sigma</m> in the <m>SE</m> calculation.
      </p>
      
      <figure xml:id="tDistCompareToNormalDist">

        <p>
          [Figure showing a standard normal distribution and a t-distribution overlaid. The t-distribution
          is more sharply peaked and has thicker tails than the normal distribution.]

      </figure>
      
      <p>
        The <m>t</m>-distribution is always centered at zero and has a single parameter: degrees of
        freedom. The <term>degrees of freedom (<m>df</m>)</term> describes the precise form of the
        bell-shaped <m>t</m>-distribution. Several <m>t</m>-distributions are shown in
        Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="tDistConvergeToNormalDist"/> in comparison to the normal distribution.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In general, we'll use a <m>t</m>-distribution with <m>df = n - 1</m> to model the sample mean
        when the sample size is <m>n</m>. That is, when we have more observations, the degrees of freedom
        will be larger and the <m>t</m>-distribution will look more like the standard normal distribution;
        when the degrees of freedom is about 30 or more, the <m>t</m>-distribution is nearly
        indistinguishable from the normal distribution.

        The <m>t</m>-distribution allows us greater flexibility than the normal distribution when
        analyzing numerical data. In practice, it's common to use statistical software, such as R, Python,
        or SAS for these analyses. Alternatively, a graphing calculator or a <term><m>t</m>-table</term>
        may be used; the <m>t</m>-table is similar to the normal distribution table, and it may be found
        in the appendix<!-- TODO: Add xref to t-distribution table appendix when available -->, which 
        includes usage instructions and examples for those who wish to use this option. No matter the

            suggest any clear outliers, since all observations are within 2.5 standard deviations of the

        When completing a hypothesis test for the one-sample mean, the process is nearly identical to
        completing a hypothesis test for a single proportion. First, we find the Z-score using the
        observed value, null value, and standard error; however, we call it a <term>T-score</term> since
        we use a <m>t</m>-distribution for calculating the tail area. Then we find the p-value using the
        same ideas we used previously: find the one-tail area under the sampling distribution, and double
        it.

        <statement>
          <p>
            With both the independence and normality conditions satisfied, we can proceed with a hypothesis
            test using the <m>t</m>-distribution. The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the
            sample of 100 runners from the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race are 97.32 and 16.98 minutes,
            respectively. Recall that the sample size is 100 and the average run time in 2006 was 93.29
            minutes. Find the test statistic and p-value. What is your conclusion?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            To find the test statistic (T-score), we first must determine the standard error:
          </p>
          <me>
            SE = 16.98 / \sqrt{100} = 1.70
          </me>
          <p>
            Now we can compute the <em>T-score</em> using the sample mean (97.32), null value (93.29),
            and <m>SE</m>:
          </p>
          <me>
            T = \frac{97.32 - 93.29}{1.70} = 2.37
          </me>
          <p>
            For <m>df = 100 - 1 = 99</m>, we can determine using statistical software (or a
            <m>t</m>-table) that the one-tail area is 0.01, which we double to get the p-value: 0.02.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data
            provide strong evidence that the average run time for the Cherry Blossom Run in 2017 is
            different than the 2006 average. Since the observed value is above the null value and we have
            rejected the null hypothesis, we would conclude that runners in the race were slower on average
            in 2017 than in 2006.

        In an earlier edition of this textbook, we found that Amazon prices were, on average, lower
        than those of the UCLA Bookstore for UCLA courses in 2010. It's been several years, and many
        stores have adapted to the online market, so we wondered, how is the UCLA Bookstore doing today?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We sampled 201 UCLA courses. Of those, 68 required books could be found on Amazon. A portion
        of the data set from these courses is shown in Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="textbooksDF"/>, where
        prices are in US dollars.

      <title>Paired observations</title>
      
      <p>
        Each textbook has two corresponding prices in the data set: one for the UCLA Bookstore and
        one for Amazon. When two sets of observations have this special correspondence, they are said
        to be <term>paired</term>.
      </p>
      
      <assemblage xml:id="paired-data-def">
        <title>Paired data</title>
        <p>
          Two sets of observations are <em>paired</em> if each observation in one set has a special
          correspondence or connection with exactly one observation in the other data set.
        </p>
      </assemblage>
      
      <p>
        To analyze paired data, it is often useful to look at the difference in outcomes of each pair
        of observations. In the textbook data, we look at the differences in prices, which is
        represented as the <c>price_difference</c> variable in the data set. Here the differences are
        taken as
      </p>
      <me>
        \text{UCLA Bookstore price} - \text{Amazon price}
      </me>
      <p>
        It is important that we always subtract using a consistent order; here Amazon prices are always
        subtracted from UCLA prices. The first difference shown in Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="textbooksDF"/>
        is computed as <m>47.97 - 47.45 = 0.52</m>. Similarly, the second difference is computed as
        <m>14.26 - 13.55 = 0.71</m>, and the third is <m>13.50 - 12.53 = 0.97</m>. A histogram of the
        differences is shown in Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="diffInTextbookPricesF18"/>. Using differences
        between paired observations is a common and useful way to analyze paired data.

            Set up a hypothesis test to determine whether, on average, there is a difference between
            Amazon's price for a book and the UCLA bookstore's price. Also, check the conditions for
            whether we can move forward with the test using the <m>t</m>-distribution.

        <solution>
          <p>
            We are considering two scenarios: there is no difference or there is some difference in

            Next, we check the independence and normality conditions. The observations are based on a
            simple random sample, so independence is reasonable. While there are some outliers,

            <m>\bar{x}</m> is satisfied. With these conditions satisfied, we can move forward with the

            The test statistic is the T-score of <m>\bar{x}_{\text{diff}}</m> under the null condition

          <p>
            To visualize the p-value, the sampling distribution of <m>\bar{x}_{\text{diff}}</m> is

            We have strong evidence that Amazon is, on average, less expensive. How should this
            conclusion affect UCLA student buying habits? Should UCLA students always buy their books on
            Amazon?<fn>The average price difference is only mildly useful for this question. Examine the
            distribution shown in Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="diffInTextbookPricesF18"/>. There are certainly
            a handful of cases where Amazon prices are far below the UCLA Bookstore's, which suggests it
            is worth checking Amazon (and probably other online sites) before purchasing. However, in many
            cases the Amazon price is above what the UCLA Bookstore charges, and most of the time the
            price isn't that different. Ultimately, if getting a book immediately from the bookstore is
            notably more convenient, e.g. to get started on reading or homework, it's likely a good idea
            to go with the UCLA Bookstore unless the price difference on a specific book happens to be
            quite large. For reference, this is a very different result from what we (the authors) had
            seen in a similar data set from 2010. At that time, Amazon prices were almost uniformly lower
            than those of the UCLA Bookstore's and by a large margin, making the case to use Amazon over
            the UCLA Bookstore quite compelling at that time. Now we frequently check multiple websites
            to find the best price.</fn>

            Let's consider a limited set of climate data, examining temperature differences in 1948 vs
            2018. We sampled 197 locations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
            (NOAA) historical data, where the data was available for both years of interest. We want to
            know: were there more days with temperatures exceeding 90°F in 2018 or in 1948? The difference
            in number of days exceeding 90°F (number of days in 2018 - number of days in 1948) was
            calculated for each of the 197 locations. The average of these differences was 2.9 days with a
            standard deviation of 17.2 days. We are interested in determining whether these data provide
            strong evidence that there were more days in 2018 that exceeded 90°F from NOAA's weather

        In this section we consider a difference in two population means, <m>\mu_1 - \mu_2</m>, under
        the condition that the data are not paired. Just as with a single sample, we identify conditions
        to ensure we can use the <m>t</m>-distribution with a point estimate of the difference,
        <m>\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2</m>, and a new standard error formula. Other than these two differences,
        the details are almost identical to the one-mean procedures.

        We apply these methods in three contexts: determining whether stem cells can improve heart
        function, exploring the relationship between pregnant womens' smoking habits and birth weights
        of newborns, and exploring whether there is statistically significant evidence that one variation
        of an exam is harder than another variation. This section is motivated by questions like
        <q>Is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average
        birth weight than newborns from mothers who don't smoke?</q>

        Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart
        attack? Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="statsSheepEscStudy"/> contains summary statistics for an
        experiment to test ESCs in sheep that had a heart attack. Each of these sheep was randomly
        assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts' pumping capacity was
        measured in the study. Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="stemCellTherapyForHearts"/> provides histograms
        of the two data sets. A positive value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which generally
        suggests a stronger recovery. Our goal will be to identify a 95% confidence interval for the
        effect of ESCs on the change in heart pumping capacity relative to the control group.

        need to check new conditions. Like the 2-proportion cases, we will require a more robust version
        of independence so we are confident the two groups are also independent. Secondly, we also check
        for normality in each group separately, which in practice is a check for outliers.

        freedom, e.g. if using a <m>t</m>-table to find tail areas. For transparency in the Examples and
        Guided Practice, we'll use the latter approach for finding <m>df</m>; in the case of the ESC

        A data set called <c>ncbirths</c> represents a random sample of 150 cases of mothers and their
        newborns in North Carolina over a year. Four cases from this data set are represented in
        Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="babySmokeDF"/>. We are particularly interested in two variables:
        <c>weight</c> and <c>smoke</c>. The <c>weight</c> variable represents the weights of the
        newborns and the <c>smoke</c> variable describes which mothers smoked during pregnancy. We
        would like to know, is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a
        different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who don't smoke? We will use the
        North Carolina sample to try to answer this question. The smoking group includes 50 cases and
        the nonsmoking group contains 100 cases.

        Public service announcement: while we have used this relatively small data set as an example,
        larger data sets show that women who smoke tend to have smaller newborns. In fact, some in the
        tobacco industry actually had the audacity to tout that as a <em>benefit</em> of smoking:

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>It's true. The babies born from women who smoke are smaller, but they're just as healthy as
          the babies born from women who do not smoke. And some women would prefer having smaller
          babies.</em>

      <title>Case study: two versions of a course exam</title>
      
      <p>
        An instructor decided to run two slight variations of the same exam. Prior to passing out the
        exams, she shuffled the exams together to ensure each student received a random version. Summary
        statistics for how students performed on these two exams are shown in
        Figure<nbsp/><xref ref="summaryStatsForTwoVersionsOfExams"/>. Anticipating complaints from
        students who took Version B, she would like to evaluate whether the difference observed in the
        groups is so large that it provides convincing evidence that Version B was more difficult (on
        average) than Version A.

        estimating the true difference in average test scores using the sample data, so the point
        estimate is <m>\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B = 5.3</m>. The standard error of the estimate can be

    <subsection xml:id="pooledStandardDeviations">
      <title>Pooled standard deviation estimate (special topic)</title>
      
      <p>
        Occasionally, two populations will have standard deviations that are so similar that they can be
        treated as identical. For example, historical data or a well-understood biological mechanism may
        justify this strong assumption. In such cases, we can make the <m>t</m>-distribution approach
        slightly more precise by using a pooled standard deviation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The <term>pooled standard deviation</term> of two groups is a way to use data from both samples
        to better estimate the standard deviation and standard error. If <m>s_1</m> and <m>s_2</m> are
        the standard deviations of groups 1 and 2 and there are very good reasons to believe that the
        population standard deviations are equal, then we can obtain an improved estimate of the group
        variances by pooling their data:
      </p>
      <me>
        s_{pooled}^2 = \frac{s_1^2\times (n_1-1) + s_2^2\times (n_2-1)}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}
      </me>
      <p>
        where <m>n_1</m> and <m>n_2</m> are the sample sizes, as before. To use this new statistic, we
        substitute <m>s_{pooled}^2</m> in place of <m>s_1^2</m> and <m>s_2^2</m> in the standard error
        formula, and we use an updated formula for the degrees of freedom:
      </p>
      <me>
        df = n_1 + n_2 - 2
      </me>
      
      <p>
        The benefits of pooling the standard deviation are realized through obtaining a better estimate
        of the standard deviation for each group and using a larger degrees of freedom parameter for the
        <m>t</m>-distribution. Both of these changes may permit a more accurate model of the sampling
        distribution of <m>\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2</m>, if the standard deviations of the two groups are
        indeed equal.
      </p>
      
      <assemblage>
        <title>Pool standard deviations only after careful consideration</title>
        <p>
          A pooled standard deviation is only appropriate when background research indicates the
          population standard deviations are nearly equal. When the sample size is large and the
          condition may be adequately checked with data, the benefits of pooling the standard deviations
          greatly diminishes.

        <title>Diamonds, Part I</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Prices of diamonds are determined by what is known as the 4 Cs: cut, clarity, color, and carat weight. The prices of diamonds go up as the carat weight increases, but the increase is not smooth. For example, the difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye, but the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 diamond. In this question we use two random samples of diamonds, 0.99 carats and 1 carat, each sample of size 23, and compare the average prices of the diamonds. In order to be able to compare equivalent units, we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats. That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond, we divide the price by 99. For a 1 carat diamond, we divide the price by 100. The distributions and some sample statistics are shown below.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Chicken farming is a multi-billion dollar industry, and any methods that increase the growth rate of young chicks can reduce consumer costs while increasing company profits, possibly by millions of dollars. An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens. Newly hatched chicks were randomly allocated into six groups, and each group was given a different feed supplement. Below are some summary statistics from this data set along with box plots showing the distribution of weights by feed type.

            Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an experiment involving an "isolation" experience. The goal of the experiment was to find a treatment that reduces subjects' psychopathic deviant T scores. This score measures a person's need for control or their rebellion against control, and it is part of a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test. The experiment had three treatment groups:

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Often times in experiment planning, there are two competing considerations:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>We want to collect enough data that we can detect important effects.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Collecting data can be expensive, and in experiments involving people, there may be some risk to patients.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      In this section, we focus on the context of a clinical trial, which is a health-related experiment where the subject are people, and we will determine an appropriate sample size where we can be 80% sure that we would detect any practically important effects.<fn>Even though we don't cover it explicitly, similar sample size planning is also helpful for observational studies.</fn>
    </p>
  </introduction>
  
  <subsection xml:id="going-through-the-motions-of-a-test">
    <title>Going through the motions of a test</title>
    
    <p>
      We're going to go through the motions of a hypothesis test. This will help us frame our calculations for determining an appropriate sample size for the study.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose a pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug for lowering blood pressure, and they are preparing a clinical trial (experiment) to test the drug's effectiveness. They recruit people who are taking a particular standard blood pressure medication. People in the control group will continue to take their current medication through generic-looking pills to ensure blinding. Write down the hypotheses for a two-sided hypothesis test in this context.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Generally, clinical trials use a two-sided alternative hypothesis, so below are suitable hypotheses for this context:
          <dl>
            <li>
              <title><m>H_0</m>:</title>
              <p>The new drug performs exactly as well as the standard medication. <m>\mu_{trmt} - \mu_{ctrl} = 0</m>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title><m>H_A</m>:</title>
              <p>The new drug's performance differs from the standard medication. <m>\mu_{trmt} - \mu_{ctrl} \neq 0</m>.</p>
            </li>
          </dl>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The researchers would like to run the clinical trial on patients with systolic blood pressures between 140 and 180<nbsp/>mmHg. Suppose previously published studies suggest that the standard deviation of the patients' blood pressures will be about 12<nbsp/>mmHg and the distribution of patient blood pressures will be approximately symmetric.<fn>In this particular study, we'd generally measure each patient's blood pressure at the beginning and end of the study, and then the outcome measurement for the study would be the average change in blood pressure. That is, both <m>\mu_{trmt}</m> and <m>\mu_{ctrl}</m> would represent average differences. This is what you might think of as a 2-sample paired testing structure, and we'd analyze it exactly just like a hypothesis test for a difference in the average change for patients. In the calculations we perform here, we'll suppose that 12<nbsp/>mmHg is the predicted standard deviation of a patient's blood pressure difference over the course of the study.</fn> If<nbsp/>we had 100 patients per group, what would be the approximate standard error for <m>\bar{x}_{trmt} - \bar{x}_{ctrl}</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The standard error is calculated as follows:

          This may be an imperfect estimate of <m>SE_{\bar{x}_{trmt} - \bar{x}_{ctrl}}</m>, since the standard deviation estimate we used may not be perfectly correct for this group of patients. However, it is sufficient for our purposes.

      When planning a study, we want to know how likely we are to detect an effect we care about. In<nbsp/>other words, if there is a real effect, and that effect is large enough that it has practical value, then what's the probability that we detect that effect? This probability is called the <term>power</term>, and we can compute it for different sample sizes or for different <em>effect sizes</em>.

    <p>
      We first determine what is a practically significant result. Suppose that the company researchers care about finding any effect on blood pressure that is 3<nbsp/>mmHg or larger vs the standard medication. Here, 3<nbsp/>mmHg is the minimum <term>effect size</term> of interest, and we want to know how likely we are to detect this size of an effect in the study.

          We'll use a normal approximation, which is good approximation when the degrees of freedom is about 30 or more. We'll start by calculating the Z-score and find the tail area using either statistical software or the probability table:

            <mrow>
              Z = \frac{-3.332 - (-3)}{1.7} = -0.20 \qquad \to \qquad 0.42

          The power for the test is about 42% when <m>\mu_{trmt} - \mu_{ctrl} = -3</m> and each group has a sample size of<nbsp/>100.

      In <xref ref="PowerFor100AtNeg3">Example</xref>, we ignored the upper rejection region in the calculation, which was in the opposite direction of the hypothetical truth, i.e. -3. The reasoning? There wouldn't be any value in rejecting the null hypothesis and concluding there was an increase when in fact there was a decrease.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We've also used a normal distribution instead of the <m>t</m>-distribution. This is a convenience, and if the sample size is too small, we'd need to revert back to using the <m>t</m>-distribution. We'll discuss this a bit further at the end of this section.

    <title>Determining a proper sample size</title>
    
    <p>
      In the last example, we found that if we have a sample size of 100 in each group, we can only detect an effect size of 3<nbsp/>mmHg with a probability of about 0.42. Suppose the researchers moved forward and only used 100 patients per group, and the data did not support the alternative hypothesis, i.e. the researchers did not reject <m>H_0</m>. This is a very bad situation to be in for a few reasons:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>In the back of the researchers' minds, they'd all be wondering, <em>maybe there is a real and meaningful difference, but we weren't able to detect it with such a small sample</em>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The company probably invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the new drug, so now they are left with great uncertainty about its potential since the experiment didn't have a great shot at detecting effects that could still be important.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Patients were subjected to the drug, and we can't even say with much certainty that the drug doesn't help (or harm) patients.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Another clinical trial may need to be run to get a more conclusive answer as to whether the drug does hold any practical value, and conducting a second clinical trial may take years and many millions of dollars.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      We want to avoid this situation, so we need to determine an appropriate sample size to ensure we can be pretty confident that we'll detect any effects that are practically important. As mentioned earlier, a change of 3<nbsp/>mmHg was deemed to be the minimum difference that was practically important. As<nbsp/>a first step, we could calculate power for several different sample sizes. For instance, let's try 500 patients per group.

      The researchers decided 3<nbsp/>mmHg was the minimum difference that was practically important, and with a sample size of<nbsp/>500, we can be very certain (97.7% or better) that we will detect any such difference. We now have moved to another extreme where we are exposing an unnecessary number of patients to the new drug in the clinical trial. Not only is this ethically questionable, but it would also cost a lot more money than is necessary to be quite sure we'd detect any important effects.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The most common practice is to identify the sample size where the power is around 80%, and sometimes 90%. Other values may be reasonable for a specific context, but 80% and 90% are most commonly targeted as a good balance between high power and not exposing too many patients to a new treatment (or wasting too much money).

          We'll assume we have a large enough sample that the normal distribution is a good approximation for the test statistic, since the normal distribution and the <m>t</m>-distribution look almost identical when the degrees of freedom are moderately large (e.g. <m>df \geq 30</m>). If that doesn't turn out to be true, then we'd need to make a correction.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We start by identifying the Z-score that would give us a lower tail of 80%. For a moderately large sample size per group, the Z-score for a lower tail of 80% would be about <m>Z = 0.84</m>.

      Had the suggested sample size been relatively small -- roughly 30 or smaller -- it would have been a good idea to rework the calculations using the degrees of fredom for the smaller sample size under that initial sample size.

      Power calculations for expensive or risky experiments are critical. However, what about experiments that are inexpensive and where the ethical considerations are minimal? For example, if we are doing final testing on a new feature on a popular website, how would our sample size considerations change? As before, we'd want to make sure the sample is big enough. However, suppose the feature has undergone some testing and is known to perform well (e.g.<nbsp/>the website's users seem to enjoy the feature). Then it may be reasonable to run a larger experiment if there's value from having a more precise estimate of the feature's effect, such as helping guide the development of the next useful feature.

    <title>Comparing many means with ANOVA</title>
    
    <p>
      Sometimes we want to compare means across many groups. We might initially think to do pairwise 
      comparisons. For example, if there were three groups, we might be tempted to compare the first 
      mean with the second, then with the third, and then finally compare the second and third means 
      for a total of three comparisons. However, this strategy can be treacherous. If we have many 
      groups and do many comparisons, it is likely that we will eventually find a difference just by 
      chance, even if there is no difference in the populations. Instead, we should apply a holistic 
      test to check whether there is evidence that at least one pair of groups are in fact different, 
      and this is where <em>ANOVA</em> saves the day.
    </p>
    
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-core-ideas-anova">
      <title>Core ideas of ANOVA</title>
      
      <p>
        In this section, we will learn a new method called <term>analysis of variance (ANOVA)</term> 
        and a new test statistic called <m>F</m>. ANOVA uses a single hypothesis test to check whether 
        the means across many groups are equal:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><m>H_0</m>: The mean outcome is the same across all groups. In statistical notation, 
            <m>\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_k</m> where <m>\mu_i</m> represents the mean of the 
            outcome for observations in category <m>i</m>.</li>
        <li><m>H_A</m>: At least one mean is different.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Generally we must check three conditions on the data before performing ANOVA:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>the observations are independent within and across groups,</li>
        <li>the data within each group are nearly normal, and</li>
        <li>the variability across the groups is about equal.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        When these three conditions are met, we may perform an ANOVA to determine whether the data 
        provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis that all the <m>\mu_i</m> are equal.
      </p>
      
      <example xml:id="ex-three-stat-classes">
        <statement>
          <p>
            College departments commonly run multiple lectures of the same introductory course each 
            semester because of high demand. Consider a statistics department that runs three lectures 
            of an introductory statistics course. We might like to determine whether there are 
            statistically significant differences in first exam scores in these three classes (<m>A</m>, 
            <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>). Describe appropriate hypotheses to determine whether there are any 
            differences between the three classes.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The hypotheses may be written in the following form:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><m>H_0</m>: The average score is identical in all lectures. Any observed difference is 
                due to chance. Notationally, we write <m>\mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C</m>.</li>
            <li><m>H_A</m>: The average score varies by class. We would reject the null hypothesis in 
                favor of the alternative hypothesis if there were larger differences among the class 
                averages than what we might expect from chance alone.</li>
          </ul>
        </solution>
      </example>
      
      <p>
        Strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis in ANOVA is described by unusually large 
        differences among the group means. We will soon learn that assessing the variability of the 
        group means relative to the variability among individual observations within each group is key 
        to ANOVA's success.

            Examine <xref ref="fig-toy-anova"/>. Compare groups I, II, and III. Can you visually determine 
            if the differences in the group centers is due to chance or not? Now compare groups IV, V, 
            and VI. Do these differences appear to be due to chance?

        <solution>
          <p>
            Any real difference in the means of groups I, II, and III is difficult to discern, because 
            the data within each group are very volatile relative to any differences in the average outcome. 
            On the other hand, it appears there are differences in the centers of groups IV, V, and VI. For 
            instance, group V appears to have a higher mean than that of the other two groups. Investigating 
            groups IV, V, and VI, we see the differences in the groups' centers are noticeable because those 
            differences are large <em>relative to the variability in the individual observations within each 
            group</em>.

      <title>Is batting performance related to player position in MLB?</title>
      
      <p>
        We would like to discern whether there are real differences between the batting performance 
        of baseball players according to their position: outfielder (OF), infielder (IF), and catcher 
        (C). We will use a data set called <c>bat18</c>, which includes batting records of 429 Major 
        League Baseball (MLB) players from the 2018 season who had at least 100 at bats. Six of the 
        429 cases represented in <c>bat18</c> are shown in <xref ref="table-mlb-bat18-sample"/>, and 
        descriptions for each variable are provided in <xref ref="table-mlb-bat18-variables"/>. The 
        measure we will use for the player batting performance (the outcome variable) is on-base 
        percentage (OBP). The on-base percentage roughly represents the fraction of the time a player 
        successfully gets on base or hits a home run.

            The primary issue here is that we are inspecting the data before picking the groups that will

            afterwards decide which parts to formally test. This is called <term>data snooping</term> or 
            <term>data fishing</term>. Naturally, we would pick the groups with the large differences for 
            the formal test, and this would lead to an inflation in the Type 1 Error rate. To understand 
            this better, let's consider a slightly different problem.

            Suppose we are to measure the aptitude for students in 20 classes in a large elementary school 
            at the beginning of the year. In this school, all students are randomly assigned to classrooms, 
            so any differences we observe between the classes at the start of the year are completely due 
            to chance. However, with so many groups, we will probably observe a few groups that look rather 
            different from each other. If we select only these classes that look so different and then 
            perform a formal test, we will probably make the wrong conclusion that the assignment wasn't 
            random. While we might only formally test differences for a few pairs of classes, we informally 
            evaluated the other classes by eye before choosing the most extreme cases for a comparison.

      <title>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the <m>F</m>-test</title>
      
      <p>
        The method of analysis of variance in this context focuses on answering one question: is the 
        variability in the sample means so large that it seems unlikely to be from chance alone? This 
        question is different from earlier testing procedures since we will <em>simultaneously</em> 
        consider many groups, and evaluate whether their sample means differ more than we would expect 
        from natural variation. We call this variability the <term>mean square between groups (MSG)</term>, 
        and it has an associated degrees of freedom, <m>df_{G} = k - 1</m> when there are <m>k</m> groups. 
        The <m>MSG</m> can be thought of as a scaled variance formula for means. If the null hypothesis is 
        true, any variation in the sample means is due to chance and shouldn't be too large. However, we 
        typically use software for these computations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The mean square between the groups is, on its own, quite useless in a hypothesis test. We need a 
        benchmark value for how much variability should be expected among the sample means if the null 
        hypothesis is true. To this end, we compute a pooled variance estimate, often abbreviated as the 
        <term>mean square error (MSE)</term>, which has an associated degrees of freedom value 
        <m>df_E = n - k</m>. It is helpful to think of <m>MSE</m> as a measure of the variability within 
        the groups.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When the null hypothesis is true, any differences among the sample means are only due to chance, 
        and the <m>MSG</m> and <m>MSE</m> should be about equal. As a test statistic for ANOVA, we examine 
        the fraction of <m>MSG</m> and <m>MSE</m>:
      </p>
      
      <md>
        <mrow>F = \frac{MSG}{MSE}</mrow>
      </md>
      
      <p>
        The <m>MSG</m> represents a measure of the between-group variability, and <m>MSE</m> measures the 
        variability within each of the groups.

            <m>n = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 429</m> total observations, so <m>df_{E} = n - k = 426</m>. Then the 
            <m>F</m> statistic is computed as the ratio of <m>MSG</m> and <m>MSE</m>: 
            <m>F = \frac{MSG}{MSE} = \frac{0.00803}{0.00158} = 5.082 \approx 5.077</m>.

      <p>
        We can use the <m>F</m> statistic to evaluate the hypotheses in what is called an 
        <term>F-test</term>. A p-value can be computed from the <m>F</m> statistic using an 
        <m>F</m> distribution, which has two associated parameters: <m>df_{1}</m> and <m>df_{2}</m>. For

      <title>Graphical diagnostics for an ANOVA analysis</title>
      
      <p>
        There are three conditions we must check for an ANOVA analysis: all observations must be 
        independent, the data in each group must be nearly normal, and the variance within each group must 
        be approximately equal.

          <title>Independence.</title>
          <p>
            If the data are a simple random sample, this condition is satisfied. For processes and 
            experiments, carefully consider whether the data may be independent (e.g. no pairing). For 
            example, in the MLB data, the data were not sampled. However, there are not obvious reasons why 
            independence would not hold for most or all observations.

            As with one- and two-sample testing for means, the normality assumption is especially important 
            when the sample size is quite small when it is ironically difficult to check for non-normality. 
            A histogram of the observations from each group is shown in <xref ref="fig-mlb-anova-histograms"/>. 
            Since each of the groups we're considering have relatively large sample sizes, what we're looking 
            for are major outliers. None are apparent, so this condition is reasonably met.

            the groups, as in <xref ref="fig-mlb-anova-boxplot"/>. In this case, the variability is similar 
            in the three groups but not identical. We see in <xref ref="table-mlb-summary-stats"/> that the

          Independence is always important to an ANOVA analysis. The normality condition is very important

      <p>
        When we reject the null hypothesis in an ANOVA analysis, we might wonder, which of these groups 
        have different means? To answer this question, we compare the means of each possible pair of groups. 
        For instance, if there are three groups and there is strong evidence that there are some differences 
        in the group means, there are three comparisons to make: group 1 to group 2, group 1 to group 3, 
        and group 2 to group 3. These comparisons can be accomplished using a two-sample <m>t</m>-test, but 
        we use a modified significance level and a pooled estimate of the standard deviation across groups. 
        Usually this pooled standard deviation can be found in the ANOVA table, e.g. along the bottom of 
        <xref ref="table-anova-summary-mlb"/>.

            three courses, and a side-by-side box plot of the data is shown in <xref ref="fig-midterm-boxplot"/>.

            In this case (like many others) it is difficult to check independence in a rigorous way. Instead, 
            the best we can do is use common sense to consider reasons the assumption of independence may not 
            hold. For instance, the independence assumption may not be reasonable if there is a star teaching 
            assistant that only half of the students may access; such a scenario would divide a class into 
            two subgroups. No such situations were evident for these particular data, and we believe that 
            independence is acceptable.

            The box plots show approximately equal variability, which can be verified in

            ANOVA was conducted for the midterm data, and summary results are shown in 
            <xref ref="table-anova-summary-midterm"/>. What should we conclude?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The p-value of the test is 0.0330, less than the default significance level of 0.05. Therefore, 
            we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in the average midterm scores is 
            not due to chance.

        There is strong evidence that the different means in each of the three classes are not simply due to 
        chance. We might wonder, which of the classes are actually different? As discussed in earlier 
        chapters, a two-sample <m>t</m>-test could be used to test for differences in each possible pair of 
        groups. However, one pitfall was discussed in <xref ref="ex-data-snooping"/>: when we run so many 
        tests, the Type 1 Error rate increases. This issue is resolved by using a modified significance level.

        <title>Multiple comparisons and the Bonferroni correction for <m>\alpha</m></title>
        <p>
          The scenario of testing many pairs of groups is called <term>multiple comparisons</term>. The 
          <term>Bonferroni correction</term> suggests that a more stringent significance level is more 
          appropriate for these tests:
        </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>\alpha^{\star} = \alpha / K</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          where <m>K</m> is the number of comparisons being considered (formally or informally). If there 
          are <m>k</m> groups, then usually all possible pairs are compared and <m>K=\frac{k(k-1)}{2}</m>.
        </p>
      </assemblage>
      
      <example xml:id="ex-midterm-pairwise">
        <statement>
          <p>
            In the previous exercise, you found strong evidence of differences in the average midterm grades 
            between the three lectures. Complete the three possible pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni 
            correction and report any differences.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We use a modified significance level of <m>\alpha^{\star} = 0.05 / 3 = 0.0167</m>. Additionally, 
            we use the pooled estimate of the standard deviation: <m>s_{pooled}=13.61</m> on <m>df=161</m>, 
            which is provided in the ANOVA summary table.
          </p>
          <p>
            <alert>Lecture A versus Lecture B:</alert> The estimated difference and standard error are, 
            respectively,
          </p>
          <md>
            <mrow>\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_{B} \amp= 75.1 - 72.0 = 3.1</mrow>
            <mrow>SE \amp= \sqrt{\frac{13.61^2}{58} + \frac{13.61^2}{55}} = 2.56</mrow>
          </md>
          <p>
            This results in a T-score of 1.21 on <m>df = 161</m> (we use the <m>df</m> associated with 
            <m>s_{pooled}</m>). Statistical software was used to precisely identify the two-sided p-value 
            since the modified significance level of 0.0167 is not found in the <m>t</m>-table. The p-value 
            (0.228) is larger than <m>\alpha^*=0.0167</m>, so there is not strong evidence of a difference 
            in the means of lectures A and B.
          </p>
          <p>
            <alert>Lecture A versus Lecture C:</alert> The estimated difference and standard error are 3.8 
            and 2.61, respectively. This results in a <m>T</m> score of 1.46 on <m>df = 161</m> and a 
            two-sided p-value of 0.1462. This p-value is larger than <m>\alpha^*</m>, so there is not strong 
            evidence of a difference in the means of lectures A and C.
          </p>
          <p>
            <alert>Lecture B versus Lecture C:</alert> The estimated difference and standard error are 6.9 
            and 2.65, respectively. This results in a <m>T</m> score of 2.60 on <m>df = 161</m> and a 
            two-sided p-value of 0.0102. This p-value is smaller than <m>\alpha^*</m>. Here we find strong 
            evidence of a difference in the means of lectures B and C.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      
      <p>
        We might summarize the findings of the analysis from <xref ref="ex-midterm-pairwise"/> using the 
        following notation:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\mu_A \amp\stackrel{?}{=} \mu_B \amp \mu_A \amp\stackrel{?}{=} \mu_C \amp \mu_B \amp\neq \mu_C</mrow>
      </md>
      
      <p>
        The midterm mean in lecture A is not statistically distinguishable from those of lectures B or C. 
        However, there is strong evidence that lectures B and C are different. In the first two pairwise 
        comparisons, we did not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Recall that failing 
        to reject <m>H_0</m> does not imply <m>H_0</m> is true.
      </p>
      
      <assemblage>
        <title>Reject <m>H_0</m> with ANOVA but find no differences in group means</title>
        <p>
          It is possible to reject the null hypothesis using ANOVA and then to not subsequently identify 
          differences in the pairwise comparisons. However, <em>this does not invalidate the ANOVA 
          conclusion</em>. It only means we have not been able to successfully identify which specific 
          groups differ in their means.
        </p>
      </assemblage>
      
      <p>
        The ANOVA procedure examines the big picture: it considers all groups simultaneously to decipher 
        whether there is evidence that some difference exists. Even if the test indicates that there is 
        strong evidence of differences in group means, identifying with high confidence a specific difference 
        as statistically significant is more difficult.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Consider the following analogy: we observe a Wall Street firm that makes large quantities of money 
        based on predicting mergers. Mergers are generally difficult to predict, and if the prediction 
        success rate is extremely high, that may be considered sufficiently strong evidence to warrant 
        investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the SEC may be quite certain 
        that there is insider trading taking place at the firm, the evidence against any single trader may 
        not be very strong. It is only when the SEC considers all the data that they identify the pattern. 
        This is effectively the strategy of ANOVA: stand back and consider all the groups simultaneously.
