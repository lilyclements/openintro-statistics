  <introduction>
    <p>
      The principles of simple linear regression lay the foundation for more sophisticated
      regression models used in a wide range of challenging settings. In this chapter, we
      explore multiple regression, which introduces the possibility of more than one predictor
      in a linear model, and logistic regression, a technique for predicting categorical
      outcomes with two levels.

    <title>Introduction to Multiple Regression</title>
    
    <p>
      Multiple regression extends simple two-variable regression to the case that still has
      one response but many predictors (denoted <m>x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots</m>). The method is
      motivated by scenarios where many variables may be simultaneously connected to an output.

      We will consider data about loans from the peer-to-peer lender, Lending Club, which is a data set we first encountered in Chapters 1 and 2. The loan data includes terms of the loan as well as information about the borrower. The outcome variable we would like to better understand is the interest rate assigned to the loan. For instance, all other characteristics held constant, does it matter how much debt someone already has? Does it matter if their income has been verified? Multiple regression will help us answer these and other questions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The data set <c>loans</c> includes results from 10,000 loans, and we'll be looking at a subset of the available variables, some of which will be new from those we saw in earlier chapters. The first six observations in the data set are shown in <xref ref="fig-loans-data-matrix"/>, and descriptions for each variable are shown in <xref ref="fig-loans-variables"/>. Notice that the past bankruptcy variable (<c>bankruptcy</c>) is an <term>indicator variable</term>, where it takes the value 1 if the borrower had a past bankruptcy in their record and 0 if not. Using an indicator variable in place of a category name allows for these variables to be directly used in regression. Two of the other variables are categorical (<c>income_ver</c> and <c>issued</c>), each of which can take one of a few different non-numerical values; we'll discuss how these are handled in the model in <xref ref="subsec-indicator-categorical-predictors"/>.

          <p>
            The <c>bankruptcy</c> variable takes one of two values: 1 when the borrower has a bankruptcy in their history and 0 otherwise. A slope of 0.74 means that the model predicts a 0.74% higher interest rate for those borrowers with a bankruptcy in their record. (See Section 7.2 for a review of the interpretation for two-level categorical predictor variables.) Examining the regression output in <xref ref="fig-int-rate-vs-past-bankr-model"/>, we can see that the p-value for <c>bankruptcy</c> is very close to zero, indicating there is strong evidence the coefficient is different from zero when using this simple one-predictor model.

        Suppose we had fit a model using a 3-level categorical variable, such as <c>income_ver</c>. The output from software is shown in <xref ref="fig-int-rate-vs-ver-income-model"/>. This regression output provides multiple rows for the <c>income_ver</c> variable. Each row represents the relative difference for each level of <c>income_ver</c>. However, we are missing one of the levels: <c>not</c> (for <em>not verified</em>). The missing level is called the <term>reference level</term>, and it represents the default level that other levels are measured against.

        <p>
          When fitting a regression model with a categorical variable that has <m>k</m> levels where <m>k > 2</m>, software will provide a coefficient for <m>k - 1</m> of those levels. For the last level that does not receive a coefficient, this is the <term>reference level</term>, and the coefficients listed for the other levels are all considered relative to this reference level.

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Each of the coefficients gives the incremental interest rate for the corresponding level relative to the <c>not</c> level, which is the reference level. For example, for a borrower whose income source and amount have been verified, the model predicts that they will have a 3.25% higher interest rate than a borrower who has not had their income source or amount verified.

      <p>
        The higher interest rate for borrowers who have verified their income source or amount is surprising. Intuitively, we'd think that a loan would look <em>less</em> risky if the borrower's income has been verified. However, note that the situation may be more complex, and there may be confounding variables that we didn't account for. For example, perhaps lenders require borrowers with poor credit to verify their income. That is, verifying income in our data set might be a signal of some concerns about the borrower rather than a reassurance that the borrower will pay back the loan. For this reason, the borrower could be deemed higher risk, resulting in a higher interest rate. (What other confounding variables might explain this counter-intuitive relationship suggested by the model?)

      <title>Including and assessing many variables in a model</title>
      
      <p>
        The world is complex, and it can be helpful to consider many factors at once in statistical modeling. For example, we might like to use the full context of borrower to predict the interest rate they receive rather than using a single variable. This is the strategy used in <term>multiple regression</term>. While we remain cautious about making any causal interpretations using multiple regression on observational data, such models are a common first step in gaining insights or providing some evidence of a causal connection.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We want to construct a model that accounts not only for any past bankruptcy or whether the borrower had their income source or amount verified, but simultaneously accounts for all the variables in the data set: <c>income_ver</c>, <c>debt_to_income</c>, <c>credit_util</c>, <c>bankruptcy</c>, <c>term</c>, <c>issued</c>, and <c>credit_checks</c>.
        <md>
          <mrow>\widehat{\text{rate}} \amp = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \mathbb{1}_{\text{income\_ver = source\_only}} + \beta_2 \times \mathbb{1}_{\text{income\_ver = verified}} + \beta_3 \times \text{debt\_to\_income}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \qquad + \beta_4 \times \text{credit\_util} + \beta_5 \times \text{bankruptcy} + \beta_6 \times \text{term}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \qquad + \beta_7 \times \mathbb{1}_{\text{issued = Jan2018}} + \beta_8 \times \mathbb{1}_{\text{issued = Mar2018}} + \beta_9 \times \text{credit\_checks}</mrow>
        </md>
        This equation represents a holistic approach for modeling all of the variables simultaneously. Notice that there are two coefficients for <c>income_ver</c> and also two coefficients for <c>issued</c>, since both are 3-level categorical variables.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We estimate the parameters <m>\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_9</m> in the same way as we did in the case of a single predictor. We select <m>b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_9</m> that minimize the sum of the squared residuals:
        <men xml:id="eq-sum-sq-res-mult-regr">
          SSE = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \cdots + e_{10000}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{10000} e_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{10000} \left(y_i - \hat{y}_i\right)^2
        </men>
        where <m>y_i</m> and <m>\hat{y}_i</m> represent the observed interest rates and their estimated values according to the model, respectively. 10,000 residuals are calculated, one for each observation. We typically use a computer to minimize the sum of squares and compute point estimates, as shown in the sample output in <xref ref="fig-loans-full-model-output"/>. Using this output, we identify the point estimates <m>b_i</m> of each <m>\beta_i</m>, just as we did in the one-predictor case.

            The estimated value of the intercept is 1.925, and one might be tempted to make some interpretation of this coefficient, such as, it is the model's predicted price when each of the variables take value zero: income source is not verified, the borrower has no debt (debt-to-income and credit utilization are zero), and so on.

            Many of the variables do take a value 0 for at least one data point, and for those variables, it is reasonable. However, one variable never takes a value of zero: <c>term</c>, which describes the length of the loan, in months. If <c>term</c> is set to zero, then the loan must be paid back immediately; the borrower must give the money back as soon as she receives it, which means it is not a real loan. Ultimately, the interpretation of the intercept in this setting is not insightful.

    <title>Checking Model Assumptions</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Like simple linear regression, multiple regression relies on several key assumptions. We can
        check these assumptions using residual plots and other diagnostic tools.

      <title>Residual Diagnostics</title>

        The residuals (observed values minus predicted values) should:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>

    <title>Introduction to Logistic Regression</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        When the response variable is binary (two categories), linear regression is not appropriate
        because it can produce predicted values outside the range [0, 1]. Logistic regression is
        designed specifically for binary response variables.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-logistic-function">
      <title>The Logistic Function</title>
      
      <p>
        The logistic function provides a smooth curve that constrains predictions to be between 0 and 1:
        <me>
          \hat{p} = \frac{e^{b_0 + b_1 x}}{1 + e^{b_0 + b_1 x}}
        </me>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This ensures that predicted probabilities are always between 0 and 1, which is crucial for
        modeling probabilities.

            The <term>odds</term> of an event occurring are defined as:

              \text{odds} = \frac{p}{1-p}
            </me>
            where <m>p</m> is the probability of the event.

        </statement>
      </definition>
      
      <p>
        The <term>log-odds</term> (also called the logit) is the natural logarithm of the odds:

        </me>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The relationship between <m>x</m> and the log-odds is linear, which makes logistic regression
        a natural extension of multiple linear regression.
