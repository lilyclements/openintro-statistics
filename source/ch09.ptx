  <introduction>
    <p>
      The principles of simple linear regression lay the foundation for more sophisticated
      regression models used in a wide range of challenging settings. In this chapter, we
      explore multiple regression, which introduces the possibility of more than one predictor
      in a linear model, and logistic regression, a technique for predicting categorical
      outcomes with two levels.

    <title>Introduction to Multiple Regression</title>
    
    <p>
      Multiple regression extends simple two-variable regression to the case that still has
      one response but many predictors (denoted <m>x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots</m>). The method is
      motivated by scenarios where many variables may be simultaneously connected to an output.

      We will consider data about loans from the peer-to-peer lender, Lending Club, which is a data set we first encountered in Chapters 1 and 2. The loan data includes terms of the loan as well as information about the borrower. The outcome variable we would like to better understand is the interest rate assigned to the loan. For instance, all other characteristics held constant, does it matter how much debt someone already has? Does it matter if their income has been verified? Multiple regression will help us answer these and other questions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The data set <c>loans</c> includes results from 10,000 loans, and we'll be looking at a subset of the available variables, some of which will be new from those we saw in earlier chapters. The first six observations in the data set are shown in <xref ref="fig-loans-data-matrix"/>, and descriptions for each variable are shown in <xref ref="fig-loans-variables"/>. Notice that the past bankruptcy variable (<c>bankruptcy</c>) is an <term>indicator variable</term>, where it takes the value 1 if the borrower had a past bankruptcy in their record and 0 if not. Using an indicator variable in place of a category name allows for these variables to be directly used in regression. Two of the other variables are categorical (<c>income_ver</c> and <c>issued</c>), each of which can take one of a few different non-numerical values; we'll discuss how these are handled in the model in <xref ref="subsec-indicator-categorical-predictors"/>.

          <p>
            The <c>bankruptcy</c> variable takes one of two values: 1 when the borrower has a bankruptcy in their history and 0 otherwise. A slope of 0.74 means that the model predicts a 0.74% higher interest rate for those borrowers with a bankruptcy in their record. (See Section 7.2 for a review of the interpretation for two-level categorical predictor variables.) Examining the regression output in <xref ref="fig-int-rate-vs-past-bankr-model"/>, we can see that the p-value for <c>bankruptcy</c> is very close to zero, indicating there is strong evidence the coefficient is different from zero when using this simple one-predictor model.

        Suppose we had fit a model using a 3-level categorical variable, such as <c>income_ver</c>. The output from software is shown in <xref ref="fig-int-rate-vs-ver-income-model"/>. This regression output provides multiple rows for the <c>income_ver</c> variable. Each row represents the relative difference for each level of <c>income_ver</c>. However, we are missing one of the levels: <c>not</c> (for <em>not verified</em>). The missing level is called the <term>reference level</term>, and it represents the default level that other levels are measured against.

        <p>
          When fitting a regression model with a categorical variable that has <m>k</m> levels where <m>k > 2</m>, software will provide a coefficient for <m>k - 1</m> of those levels. For the last level that does not receive a coefficient, this is the <term>reference level</term>, and the coefficients listed for the other levels are all considered relative to this reference level.

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Each of the coefficients gives the incremental interest rate for the corresponding level relative to the <c>not</c> level, which is the reference level. For example, for a borrower whose income source and amount have been verified, the model predicts that they will have a 3.25% higher interest rate than a borrower who has not had their income source or amount verified.

      <p>
        The higher interest rate for borrowers who have verified their income source or amount is surprising. Intuitively, we'd think that a loan would look <em>less</em> risky if the borrower's income has been verified. However, note that the situation may be more complex, and there may be confounding variables that we didn't account for. For example, perhaps lenders require borrowers with poor credit to verify their income. That is, verifying income in our data set might be a signal of some concerns about the borrower rather than a reassurance that the borrower will pay back the loan. For this reason, the borrower could be deemed higher risk, resulting in a higher interest rate. (What other confounding variables might explain this counter-intuitive relationship suggested by the model?)

      <title>Including and assessing many variables in a model</title>
      
      <p>
        The world is complex, and it can be helpful to consider many factors at once in statistical modeling. For example, we might like to use the full context of borrower to predict the interest rate they receive rather than using a single variable. This is the strategy used in <term>multiple regression</term>. While we remain cautious about making any causal interpretations using multiple regression on observational data, such models are a common first step in gaining insights or providing some evidence of a causal connection.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We want to construct a model that accounts not only for any past bankruptcy or whether the borrower had their income source or amount verified, but simultaneously accounts for all the variables in the data set: <c>income_ver</c>, <c>debt_to_income</c>, <c>credit_util</c>, <c>bankruptcy</c>, <c>term</c>, <c>issued</c>, and <c>credit_checks</c>.
        <md>
          <mrow>\widehat{\text{rate}} \amp = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \mathbb{1}_{\text{income\_ver = source\_only}} + \beta_2 \times \mathbb{1}_{\text{income\_ver = verified}} + \beta_3 \times \text{debt\_to\_income}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \qquad + \beta_4 \times \text{credit\_util} + \beta_5 \times \text{bankruptcy} + \beta_6 \times \text{term}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \qquad + \beta_7 \times \mathbb{1}_{\text{issued = Jan2018}} + \beta_8 \times \mathbb{1}_{\text{issued = Mar2018}} + \beta_9 \times \text{credit\_checks}</mrow>
        </md>
        This equation represents a holistic approach for modeling all of the variables simultaneously. Notice that there are two coefficients for <c>income_ver</c> and also two coefficients for <c>issued</c>, since both are 3-level categorical variables.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We estimate the parameters <m>\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_9</m> in the same way as we did in the case of a single predictor. We select <m>b_0, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_9</m> that minimize the sum of the squared residuals:
        <men xml:id="eq-sum-sq-res-mult-regr">
          SSE = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \cdots + e_{10000}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{10000} e_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{10000} \left(y_i - \hat{y}_i\right)^2
        </men>
        where <m>y_i</m> and <m>\hat{y}_i</m> represent the observed interest rates and their estimated values according to the model, respectively. 10,000 residuals are calculated, one for each observation. We typically use a computer to minimize the sum of squares and compute point estimates, as shown in the sample output in <xref ref="fig-loans-full-model-output"/>. Using this output, we identify the point estimates <m>b_i</m> of each <m>\beta_i</m>, just as we did in the one-predictor case.

While it is impossible to prevent collinearity from arising in observational data, experiments are usually designed to prevent predictors from being collinear.

            The estimated value of the intercept is 1.925, and one might be tempted to make some interpretation of this coefficient, such as, it is the model's predicted price when each of the variables take value zero: income source is not verified, the borrower has no debt (debt-to-income and credit utilization are zero), and so on.

            Many of the variables do take a value 0 for at least one data point, and for those variables, it is reasonable. However, one variable never takes a value of zero: <c>term</c>, which describes the length of the loan, in months. If <c>term</c> is set to zero, then the loan must be paid back immediately; the borrower must give the money back as soon as they receive it, which means it is not a real loan. Ultimately, the interpretation of the intercept in this setting is not insightful.

            The variability within the smokers and non-smokers are about equal and the distributions are symmetric. With these conditions satisfied, it is reasonable to apply the model. (Note that we don't need to check linearity since the predictor has only two levels.)

A more realistic approach to modeling infant weights is to consider all possibly related variables at once. Other variables of interest include length of pregnancy in days (<c>gestation</c>), mother's age in years (<c>age</c>), mother's height in inches (<c>height</c>), and mother's pregnancy weight in pounds (<c>weight</c>).

        <title>Cherry trees</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Timber yield is approximately equal to the volume of a tree, however, this value is difficult to measure without first cutting the tree down. Instead, other variables, such as height and diameter, may be used to predict a tree's volume and yield. Researchers wanting to understand the relationship between these variables for black cherry trees collected data from 31 such trees in the Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania. Height is measured in feet, diameter in inches (at 54 inches above ground), and volume in cubic feet.

    <title>Model Selection</title>
    
    <p>
      The best model is not always the most complicated. Sometimes including variables that are not evidently important can actually reduce the accuracy of predictions. In this section, we discuss model selection strategies, which will help us eliminate variables from the model that are found to be less important. It's common (and hip, at least in the statistical world) to refer to models that have undergone such variable pruning as <term>parsimonious</term>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In practice, the model that includes all available explanatory variables is often referred to as the <term>full model</term>. The full model may not be the best model, and if it isn't, we want to identify a smaller model that is preferable.
    </p>

      <title>Identifying variables in the model that may not be helpful</title>
      
      <p>
        Adjusted <m>R^2</m> describes the strength of a model fit, and it is a useful tool for evaluating which predictors are adding value to the model, where <em>adding value</em> means they are (likely) improving the accuracy in predicting future outcomes.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Let's consider two models, which are shown in <xref ref="fig-loans-full-model-selection"/> and <xref ref="fig-loans-model-all-but-issued"/>. The first table summarizes the full model since it includes all predictors, while the second does not include the <c>issued</c> variable.

      <title>Two model selection strategies</title>
      
      <p>
        Two common strategies for adding or removing variables in a multiple regression model are called <em>backward elimination</em> and <em>forward selection</em>. These techniques are often referred to as <term>stepwise</term> model selection strategies, because they add or delete one variable at a time as they <q>step</q> through the candidate predictors.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <term>Backward elimination</term> starts with the model that includes all potential predictor variables. Variables are eliminated one-at-a-time from the model until we cannot improve the adjusted <m>R^2</m>. The strategy within each elimination step is to eliminate the variable that leads to the largest improvement in adjusted <m>R^2</m>.

        <title>Model selection strategies</title>
        <p>
          Backward elimination begins with the model having the largest number of predictors and eliminates variables one-by-one until we are satisfied that all remaining variables are important to the model. Forward selection starts with no variables included in the model, then it adds in variables according to their importance until no other important variables are found.
        </p>
      </assemblage>
      
      <p>
        Backward elimination and forward selection sometimes arrive at different final models. If trying both techniques and this happens, it's common to choose the model with the larger <m>R_{adj}^2</m>.

      <title>The p-value approach, an alternative to adjusted <m>R^2</m></title>
      
      <p>
        The p-value may be used as an alternative to <m>R_{adj}^2</m> for model selection:

      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Backward elimination with the p-value approach</title>
          <p>
            In backward elimination, we would identify the predictor corresponding to the largest p-value. If the p-value is above the significance level, usually <m>\alpha = 0.05</m>, then we would drop that variable, refit the model, and repeat the process. If the largest p-value is less than <m>\alpha = 0.05</m>, then we would not eliminate any predictors and the current model would be our best-fitting model.

          <title>Forward selection with the p-value approach</title>
          <p>
            In forward selection with p-values, we reverse the process. We begin with a model that has no predictors, then we fit a model for each possible predictor, identifying the model where the corresponding predictor's p-value is smallest. If that p-value is smaller than <m>\alpha = 0.05</m>, we add it to the model and repeat the process, considering whether to add more variables one-at-a-time. When none of the remaining predictors can be added to the model and have a p-value less than 0.05, then we stop adding variables and the current model would be our best-fitting model.

If we were using the p-value approach with backward elimination and we were considering this model, which of these variables would be up for elimination? Would we drop that variable, or would we keep it in the model?

        <solution>
          <p>
            The <c>bankruptcy</c> predictor is up for elimination since it has the largest p-value. However, since that p-value is smaller than 0.05, we would still keep it in the model.

        While the adjusted <m>R^2</m> and p-value approaches are similar, they sometimes lead to different models, with the <m>R_{adj}^2</m> approach tending to include more predictors in the final model.

        <p>
          When we care about understanding which variables are statistically significant predictors of the response, or if there is interest in producing a simpler model at the potential cost of a little prediction accuracy, then the p-value approach is preferred.

            <p>
              In theory, the distribution of the residuals should be nearly normal; in practice, normality can be relaxed for most applications. Instead, we examine a histogram of the residuals to check if there are any outliers: <xref ref="fig-loans-diag-normal-histogram"/> is a histogram of the residuals. Since this is a very large data set, only particularly extreme observations would be a concern in this particular case. There are no extreme observations that might cause a concern.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we intended to construct what are called <term>prediction intervals</term> for future observations, we would be more strict and require the residuals to be nearly normal. Prediction intervals are further discussed in an online extra on the OpenIntro website: <url href="https://www.openintro.org/d?id=stat_extra_linear_regression_supp">www.openintro.org/d?id=stat_extra_linear_regression_supp</url>

              We consider a plot of the residuals against each of the predictors in <xref ref="fig-loans-diag-evs-variables"/>. For those instances where there are only 2-3 groups, box plots are shown. For the numerical outcomes, a smoothed line has been fit to the data to make it easier to review. Ultimately, we are looking for any notable change in variability between groups or pattern in the data.

        Having reviewed the diagnostic plots, there are two options. The first option is to, if we're not concerned about the issues observed, use this as the final model; if going this route, it is important to still note any abnormalities observed in the diagnostics. The second option is to try to improve the model, which is what we'll try to do with this particular model fit.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-improving-model-fit">
      <title>Options for improving the model fit</title>
      
      <p>
        There are several options for improvement of a model, including transforming variables, seeking out additional variables to fill model gaps, or using more advanced methods that would account for challenges around inconsistent variability or nonlinear relationships between predictors and the outcome.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The main concern for the initial model is that there is a notable nonlinear relationship between the debt-to-income variable observed in <xref ref="fig-loans-diag-evs-variables"/>. To resolve this issue, we're going to consider a couple strategies for adjusting the relationship between the predictor variable and the outcome.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Let's start by taking a look at a histogram of <c>debt_to_income</c> in <xref ref="fig-loans-debt-to-income-hist"/>. The variable is extremely skewed, and upper values will have a lot of leverage on the fit. Below are several options:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>log transformation (<m>\log x</m>),</p></li>
          <li><p>square root transformation (<m>\sqrt{x}</m>),</p></li>
          <li><p>inverse transformation (<m>1 / x</m>),</p></li>
          <li><p>truncation (cap the max value possible)</p></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If we inspected the data more closely, we'd observe some instances where the variable takes a value of 0, and since <m>\log(0)</m> and <m>1 / x</m> are undefined when <m>x = 0</m>, we'll exclude these transformations from further consideration.<fn>There are ways to make them work, but we'll leave those options to a later course.</fn> A square root transformation is valid for all values the variable takes, and truncating some of the larger observations is also a valid approach. We'll consider both of these approaches.
      </p>
      
      <figure xml:id="fig-loans-debt-to-income-hist">
        <caption>Histogram of <c>debt_to_income</c>, where extreme skew is evident.</caption>
        <image source="ch_regr_mult_and_log/figures/loansDiagnostics/loansDebtToIncomeHist" width="62%">
          <description>A histogram showing debt-to-income ratio with extreme right skew, where most values are below 50 but a few extend to over 150.</description>
        </image>
      </figure>
      
      <p>
        To try transforming the variable, we make two new variables representing the transformed versions:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>Square root</title>
            <p>
              We create a new variable, <c>sqrt_debt_to_income</c>, where all the values are simply the square roots of the values in <c>debt_to_income</c>, and then refit the model as before. The result is shown in the left panel of <xref ref="fig-loans-diag-evs-transform-debt-to-income"/>. The square root pulled in the higher values a bit, but the fit still doesn't look great since the smoothed line is still wavy.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Truncate at 50</title>
            <p>
              We create a new variable, <c>debt_to_income_50</c>, where any values in <c>debt_to_income</c> that are greater than 50 are shrunk to exactly 50. Refitting the model once more, the diagnostic plot for this new variable is shown in the right panel of <xref ref="fig-loans-diag-evs-transform-debt-to-income"/>. Here the fit looks much more reasonable, so this appears to be a reasonable approach.
            </p>
          </li>
        </dl>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The downside of using transformations is that it reduces the ease of interpreting the results. Fortunately, since the truncation transformation only affects a relatively small number of cases, the interpretation isn't dramatically impacted.
      </p>
      
      <figure xml:id="fig-loans-diag-evs-transform-debt-to-income">
        <caption>Residual plots for transformed versions of the debt-to-income variable.</caption>
        <image source="ch_regr_mult_and_log/figures/loansDiagnostics/loansDiagEvsTransformDebtToIncome" width="90%">
          <description>Two residual plots are shown, each with a flexible trend line overlaid. The first residual plot is against the variable "Square root of Debt to Income", which shows relative stability of the trend line with some deviation downwards on the right where there are almost no values and so is less relevant. The second residual plot is against the variable "Debt to Income, truncated at 50", which shows general stability in the trend line throughout the plot.</description>
        </image>
      </figure>
      
      <p>
        As a next step to evaluate the new model using the truncated version of <c>debt_to_income</c>, we would complete all the same procedures as before. The other two issues noted while inspecting diagnostics in <xref ref="subsec-diagnostic-plots"/> are still present in the updated model. If we choose to report this model, we would want to also discuss these shortcomings to be transparent in our work. Depending on what the model will be used for, we could either try to bring those under control, or we could stop since those issues aren't severe. Had the non-constant variance been a little more dramatic, it would be a higher priority. Ultimately we decided that the model was reasonable, and we report its final form here:
        <md>
          <mrow>\widehat{\text{rate}} \amp = 1.562 + 1.002 \times \mathbb{1}_{\text{income\_ver = source\_only}} + 2.436 \times \mathbb{1}_{\text{income\_ver = verified}}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \qquad + 0.048 \times \text{debt\_to\_income\_50} + 4.694 \times \text{credit\_util} + 0.394 \times \text{bankruptcy}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \qquad + 0.153 \times \text{term} + 0.223 \times \text{credit\_checks}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A sharp eye would notice that the coefficient for <c>debt_to_income_50</c> is more than twice as large as what the coefficient had been for the <c>debt_to_income</c> variable in the earlier model. This suggests those larger values not only were points with high leverage, but they were influential points that were dramatically impacting the coefficient.
      </p>

        <title><q>All models are wrong, but some are useful</q> <mdash/> George E.P. Box</title>
        <p>
          The truth is that no model is perfect. However, even imperfect models can be useful. Reporting a flawed model can be reasonable so long as we are clear and report the model's shortcomings.
        </p>
      </assemblage>

        Don't report results when conditions are grossly violated. While there is a little leeway in model conditions, don't go too far.

            A FiveThirtyEight.com article reports that <q>Horror movies get nowhere near as much draw at the box office as the big-time summer blockbusters or action/adventure movies ... but there's a huge incentive for studios to continue pushing them out. The return-on-investment potential for horror movies is absurd.</q> To investigate how the return-on-investment compares between genres and how this relationship has changed over time, an introductory statistics student fit a model predicting the ratio of gross revenue of movies from genre and release year for 1,070 movies released between 2000 and 2018. Using the plots given below, determine if this regression model is appropriate for these data.

    <title>Multiple regression case study: Mario Kart</title>
    
    <p>
      We'll consider eBay auctions of a video game called <em>Mario Kart</em> for the Nintendo Wii. The outcome variable of interest is the total price of an auction, which is the highest bid plus the shipping cost. We will try to determine how total price is related to each characteristic in an auction while simultaneously controlling for other variables. For instance, all other characteristics held constant, are longer auctions associated with higher or lower prices? And, on average, how much more do buyers tend to pay for additional Wii wheels (plastic steering wheels that attach to the Wii controller) in auctions? Multiple regression will help us answer these and other questions.

            Write down the equation for the model, note whether the slope is statistically different from zero, and interpret the coefficient.

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The equation for the line may be written as
            <me>
              \widehat{\text{price}} = 42.87 + 10.90 \times \text{cond\_new}
            </me>
            Examining the regression output, we can see that the p-value for <c>cond_new</c> is very close to zero, indicating there is strong evidence that the coefficient is different from zero when using this simple one-variable model.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <c>cond_new</c> is a two-level categorical variable that takes value 1 when the game is new and value 0 when the game is used. This means the 10.90 model coefficient predicts an extra $10.90 for those games that are new versus those that are used.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </exercise>
      
      <p>
        Sometimes there are underlying structures or relationships between predictor variables. For instance, new games sold on eBay tend to come with more Wii wheels, which may have led to higher prices for those auctions. We would like to fit a model that includes all potentially important variables simultaneously. This would help us evaluate the relationship between a predictor variable and the outcome while controlling for the potential influence of other variables.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We want to construct a model that accounts for not only the game condition, as in <xref ref="exer-cond-new-mario-kart"/>, but simultaneously accounts for three other variables:
        <md>
          <mrow>\widehat{\text{price}} \amp = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{cond\_new} + \beta_2 \times \text{stock\_photo}</mrow>

          <p>
            If we examined the data carefully, we would see that there is collinearity among some predictors. For instance, when we estimated the connection of the outcome <c>price</c> and predictor <c>cond_new</c> using simple linear regression, we were unable to control for other variables like the number of Wii wheels included in the auction. That model was biased by the confounding variable <c>wheels</c>. When we use both variables, this particular underlying and unintentional bias is reduced or eliminated (though bias from other confounding variables may still remain).

            The third model without <c>duration</c> has the highest <m>R_{adj}^2</m> of 0.7128, so we compare it to <m>R_{adj}^2</m> for the full model. Because eliminating <c>duration</c> leads to a model with a higher <m>R_{adj}^2</m>, we drop <c>duration</c> from the model.

These plots are shown in <xref ref="fig-mk-diagnostic-evs-variables"/>. For the two-level condition variable, we are guaranteed not to see any remaining trend, and instead we are checking that the variability doesn't fluctuate across groups, which it does not. However, looking at the stock photo variable, we find that there is some difference in the variability of the residuals in the two groups. Additionally, when we consider the residuals against the <c>wheels</c> variable, we see some possible structure. There appears to be curvature in the residuals, indicating the relationship is probably not linear.

        As with the <c>loans</c> analysis, we would summarize diagnostics when reporting the model results. In the case of this auction data, we would report that there appears to be non-constant variance in the stock photo variable and that there may be a nonlinear relationship between the total price and the number of wheels included for an auction. This information would be important to buyers and sellers who may review the analysis, and omitting this information could be a setback to the very people who the model might assist.

    <title>Introduction to Logistic Regression</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        When the response variable is binary (two categories), linear regression is not appropriate
        because it can produce predicted values outside the range [0, 1]. Logistic regression is
        designed specifically for binary response variables.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-logistic-function">
      <title>The Logistic Function</title>
      
      <p>
        The logistic function provides a smooth curve that constrains predictions to be between 0 and 1:
        <me>
          \hat{p} = \frac{e^{b_0 + b_1 x}}{1 + e^{b_0 + b_1 x}}
        </me>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This ensures that predicted probabilities are always between 0 and 1, which is crucial for
        modeling probabilities.

      <p>
        The <term>log-odds</term> (also called the logit) is the natural logarithm of the odds:

        </me>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The relationship between <m>x</m> and the log-odds is linear, which makes logistic regression
        a natural extension of multiple linear regression.
