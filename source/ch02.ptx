  <title>Summarizing data</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      This chapter focuses on the mechanics and construction of summary statistics and graphs.
      We use statistical software for generating the summaries and graphs presented in this chapter and book.
      However, since this might be your first exposure to these concepts, we take our time in this chapter to detail
      how to create them.
      Mastery of the content presented in this chapter will be crucial for understanding the methods and
      techniques introduced in rest of the book.

  <section xml:id="sec-numerical-data">
    <title>Examining numerical data</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this section we will explore techniques for summarizing numerical variables.
        For example, consider the <c>loan_amount</c> variable from the <c>loan50</c> data set,
        which represents the loan size for all 50 loans in the data set.
        This variable is numerical since we can sensibly discuss the numerical difference of the size of two loans.
        On the other hand, area codes and zip codes are not numerical, but rather they are categorical variables.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout this section and the next, we will apply these methods using the <c>loan50</c> and <c>county</c>
        data sets, which were introduced in <xref ref="sec-data-basics"/>.
        If you'd like to review the variables from either data set, see the relevant data description figures.

      <title>Scatterplots for paired data</title>

      <p>
        A <term>scatterplot</term> provides a case-by-case view of data for two numerical variables.
        In a previous figure, a scatterplot was used to examine the homeownership rate against the fraction
        of housing units that were part of multi-unit properties (e.g. apartments) in the <c>county</c> data set.
        Another scatterplot is shown in <xref ref="fig-loan50-amt-vs-income"/>, comparing the total income of
        a borrower (<c>total_income</c>) and the amount they borrowed (<c>loan_amount</c>) for the <c>loan50</c> data set.
        In any scatterplot, each point represents a single case.
        Since there are 50 cases in <c>loan50</c>, there are 50 points in <xref ref="fig-loan50-amt-vs-income"/>.
      </p>

          <description>
            A scatterplot is shown with "Total Income" along the horizontal axis (range from $0 to $325,000) and
            "Loan Amount" along the vertical axis (range from $0 to $40,000). The points lie in a range from $2,000
            to $33,000 in loan amount when total income is smaller than $150,000 (representing most of the points).
            The range of loan amounts is higher when total income is greater than $175,000, with the range of
            observations being about $15,000 to $40,000.
          </description>
        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Looking at <xref ref="fig-loan50-amt-vs-income"/>, we see that there are many borrowers with an income
        below $100,000 on the left side of the graph, while there are a handful of borrowers with income above $250,000.

            A scatterplot of a few thousand points is shown with "Poverty Rate" along the horizontal axis
            (range from 0% to 55%) and "Median Household Income" along the vertical axis (range from $0 to $130,000).
            A curved trend line is overlaid on the points starting higher on the left and decreasing as it moves right,
            but it starts flattening the further right it goes. Below 10% poverty rate, points range from about $40,000
            to $130,000. Between 10% to 20%, the range is lower at about $25,000 to close to $100,000. For 20% to 30%,
            the points range from about $22,000 to just over $60,000. For 30% to 50%, the trend is mostly flat with
            values ranging from about $20,000 to $50,000.

      <p>
        Sometimes two variables are one too many: only one variable may be of interest.
        In these cases, a dot plot provides the most basic of displays.
        A <term>dot plot</term> is a one-variable scatterplot; an example using the interest rate of 50 loans
        is shown in <xref ref="fig-loan-int-rate-dot-plot"/>.

        The <term>mean</term>, often called the <term>average</term>, is a common way to measure the center of a
        <term>distribution</term> of data. To compute the mean interest rate, we add up all the interest rates and
        divide by the number of observations:
        <md>
          <mrow>\bar{x} = \frac{10.90\% + 9.92\% + 26.30\% + \cdots + 6.08\%}{50} = 11.57\%</mrow>
        </md>
        The sample mean is often labeled <m>\bar{x}</m>. The letter <m>x</m> is being used as a generic placeholder
        for the variable of interest, <c>interest_rate</c>, and the bar over the <m>x</m> communicates we're looking
        at the average interest rate, which for these 50 loans was 11.57%. It is useful to think of the mean as the
        balancing point of the distribution, and it's shown as a triangle in <xref ref="fig-loan-int-rate-dot-plot"/>
        and <xref ref="fig-loan-int-rate-dot-plot-stacked"/>.

        The <c>loan50</c> data set represents a sample from a larger population of loans made through Lending Club.
        We could compute a mean for this population in the same way as the sample mean.
        However, the population mean has a special label: <m>\mu</m>.
        The symbol <m>\mu</m> is the Greek letter <em>mu</em> and represents the average of all observations in the population.
        Sometimes a subscript, such as <m>_x</m>, is used to represent which variable the population mean refers to,
        e.g. <m>\mu_x</m>. Often times it is too expensive to measure the population mean precisely, so we often
        estimate <m>\mu</m> using the sample mean, <m>\bar{x}</m>.

            this is our single best guess of the average interest rate of all the loans in the population under study.
            In later chapters, we will develop tools to characterize the accuracy of <term>point estimates</term>
            like the sample mean. As you might have guessed, point estimates based on larger samples tend to be

                  We would like to understand if a new drug is more effective at treating asthma attacks than
                  the standard drug. A trial of 1500 adults is set up, where 500 receive the new drug, and 1000
                  receive a standard drug in the control group. The results show 200 asthma attacks in the new
                  drug group and 300 in the standard drug group. Comparing the raw counts of 200 to 300 asthma
                  attacks would make it appear that the new drug is better, but this is an artifact of the
                  imbalanced group sizes. Instead, we should look at the average number of asthma attacks per
                  patient in each group: New drug: <m>200 / 500 = 0.4</m>, Standard drug: <m>300 / 1000 = 0.3</m>.
                  The standard drug has a lower average number of asthma attacks per patient than the average in

            Suppose we want to compute the average income per person in the US. To do so, we might first think
            to take the mean of the per capita incomes across the 3,142 counties in the <c>county</c> data set.
            What would be a better approach?

            The <c>county</c> data set is special in that each county actually represents many individual people.
            If we were to simply average across the income variable, we would be treating counties with 5,000 and
            5,000,000 residents equally in the calculations. Instead, we should compute the total income for each
            county, add up all the counties' totals, and then divide by the number of people in all the counties.
            If we completed these steps with the <c>county</c> data, we would find that the per capita income for
            the US is $30,861. Had we computed the simple mean of per capita income across counties, the result
            would have been just $26,093! This example used what is called a <term>weighted mean</term>.

        Dot plots show the exact value for each observation. This is useful for small data sets, but they can
        become hard to read with larger samples. Rather than showing the value of each observation, we prefer
        to think of the value as belonging to a <em>bin</em>. For example, in the <c>loan50</c> data set, we
        created a table of counts for the number of loans with interest rates between 5.0% and 7.5%, then the
        number of loans with rates between 7.5% and 10.0%, and so on. Observations that fall on the boundary
        of a bin (e.g. 10.00%) are allocated to the lower bin. This tabulation is shown in
        <xref ref="table-binned-int-rate"/>. These binned counts are plotted as bars in

        Histograms provide a view of the <term>data density</term>. Higher bars represent where the data are
        relatively more common. For instance, there are many more loans with rates between 5% and 10% than loans
        with rates between 20% and 25% in the data set. The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data
        changes relative to the interest rate.

      <p>
        Histograms are especially convenient for understanding the shape of the data distribution.
        <xref ref="fig-loan50-int-rate-hist"/> suggests that most loans have rates under 15%, while only a
        handful of loans have rates above 20%. When data trail off to the right in this way and has a longer
        right tail, the shape is said to be <term>right skewed</term>.<fn>Other ways to describe data that are
        right skewed: skewed to the right, skewed to the high end, or skewed to the positive end.</fn>

      <p>
        Data sets with the reverse characteristic <mdash/> a long, thinner tail to the left <mdash/> are said
        to be <term>left skewed</term>. We also say that such a distribution has a long left tail. Data sets
        that show roughly equal trailing off in both directions are called <term>symmetric</term>.

        In addition to looking at whether a distribution is skewed or symmetric, histograms can be used to
        identify modes. A <term>mode</term> is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution. There is
        only one prominent peak in the histogram of <c>loan_amount</c>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A definition of <em>mode</em> sometimes taught in math classes is the value with the most occurrences
        in the data set. However, for many real-world data sets, it is common to have <em>no</em> observations
        with the same value in a data set, making this definition impractical in data analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        <xref ref="fig-modal-plots"/> shows histograms that have one, two, or three prominent peaks. Such
        distributions are called <term>unimodal</term>, <term>bimodal</term>, and <term>multimodal</term>,
        respectively. Any distribution with more than 2 prominent peaks is called multimodal. Notice that there
        was one prominent peak in the unimodal distribution with a second less prominent peak that was not
        counted since it only differs from its neighboring bins by a few observations.

    <!-- Subsection 2.1.4: Variance and standard deviation -->
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-variance-sd">
      <title>Variance and standard deviation</title>

      <p>
        The mean was introduced as a method to describe the center of a data set, and variability in the data
        is also important. Here, we introduce two measures of variability: the variance and the standard
        deviation. Both of these are very useful in data analysis, even though their formulas are a bit tedious
        to calculate by hand. The standard deviation is the easier of the two to comprehend, and it roughly
        describes how far away the typical observation is from the mean.
      </p>

      <p>
        We call the distance of an observation from its mean its <term>deviation</term>. Below are the deviations
        for the 1<m>^{st}</m>, 2<m>^{nd}</m>, 3<m>^{rd}</m>, and 50<m>^{th}</m> observations in the
        <c>interest_rate</c> variable:
        <md>
          <mrow>x_1 - \bar{x} \amp = 10.90 - 11.57 = -0.67</mrow>
          <mrow>x_2 - \bar{x} \amp = 9.92 - 11.57 = -1.65</mrow>
          <mrow>x_3 - \bar{x} \amp = 26.30 - 11.57 = 14.73</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \vdots</mrow>
          <mrow>x_{50} - \bar{x} \amp = 6.08 - 11.57 = -5.49</mrow>
        </md>
        If we square these deviations and then take an average, the result is equal to the sample
        <term>variance</term>, denoted by <m>s^2</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>s^2 \amp = \frac{(-0.67)^2 + (-1.65)^2 + (14.73)^2 + \cdots + (-5.49)^2}{50-1}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = \frac{0.45 + 2.72 + 216.97 + \cdots + 30.14}{49}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 25.52</mrow>
        </md>
        We divide by <m>n - 1</m>, rather than dividing by <m>n</m>, when computing a sample's variance; there's
        some mathematical nuance here, but the end result is that doing this makes this statistic slightly more
        reliable and useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notice that squaring the deviations does two things. First, it makes large values relatively much larger,
        seen by comparing <m>(-0.67)^2</m>, <m>(-1.65)^2</m>, <m>(14.73)^2</m>, and <m>(-5.49)^2</m>. Second, it
        gets rid of any negative signs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <term>standard deviation</term> is defined as the square root of the variance:
        <md>
          <mrow>s = \sqrt{25.52} = 5.05</mrow>
        </md>
        While often omitted, a subscript of <m>_x</m> may be added to the variance and standard deviation, i.e.
        <m>s_x^2</m> and <m>s_x</m>, if it is useful as a reminder that these are the variance and standard
        deviation of the observations represented by <m>x_1</m>, <m>x_2</m>, ..., <m>x_n</m>.
      </p>

      <assemblage xml:id="def-variance-sd">
        <title>Variance and standard deviation</title>
        <p>
          The variance is the average squared distance from the mean. The standard deviation is the square root
          of the variance. The standard deviation is useful when considering how far the data are distributed
          from the mean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standard deviation represents the typical deviation of observations from the mean. Usually about
          70% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean and about 95% will be within two
          standard deviations. However, these percentages are not strict rules.
        </p>
      </assemblage>

      <p>
        Like the mean, the population values for variance and standard deviation have special symbols: <m>\sigma^2</m>
        for the variance and <m>\sigma</m> for the standard deviation. The symbol <m>\sigma</m> is the Greek
        letter <em>sigma</em>.

            A dot plot of 50 observations is shown with values ranging from about 5% to 26%. The data set is the
            same as that shown in earlier dot plots, where the data is more dense from 5% to about 11%, has medium
            density from about 12% to 20%, and then there are a few more values scattered in the 20% to 27% range.
            Shading is shown to represent the regions within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations. The region within 1
            standard deviation is from 6.5% to 16.7%, representing 34 of the 50 data points. The region within 2
            standard deviations runs left off of the chart (but would be from about 1.4%) to 21.8% and contains 48
            of the 50 data points. The third standard deviation is shown to extend out to 26.9%, and all 50
            observations are contained within the 3 standard deviations.

        70% of the data are within 1 standard deviation of the mean and 95% within 2 standard deviations, though
        this is far from a hard rule.

            a peak at about -0.7 and then a slow decline of values to about half the max height at 1 and further

            skewed) and the first two. While a picture, like a histogram, tells a more complete story, we can use
            modality and shape (symmetry/skew) to characterize basic information about a distribution.

            What is shown is a dot plot adjacent to what is called a "box plot". The data values are the same ones
            used in past dot plots, where the data shows greatest density from 5% to 11%, moderate density from 12%
            to 20%, and then a few more values at about 22%, 25%, and 26%. The box plot adjacent to the data shows
            a box that would encapsulate the middle 50% of the data, from about 8% to 13%. The median is also
            annotated with a line through the center of the box. From here, the data extend out with "whiskers" up
            to a distance up to 1.5 times IQR below and above the box to capture as much data as possible. There are
            two observations that extend beyond this range at 25% and 26%.

        the median and other 50% falling above the median. There are 50 loans in the data set (an even number)
        so the data are perfectly split into two groups of 25. We take the median in this case to be the average
        of the two observations closest to the 50<m>^{th}</m> percentile, which happen to be the same value in
        this data set: <m>(9.93\% + 9.93\%) / 2 = 9.93\%</m>. When there are an odd number of observations,
        there will be exactly one observation that splits the data into two halves, and in such a case that
        observation is the median (no average needed).

        Extending out from the box, the <term>whiskers</term> attempt to capture the data outside of the box.
        However, their reach is never allowed to be more than <m>1.5 \times IQR</m>. They capture everything
        within this reach. In <xref ref="fig-loan-int-rate-boxplot"/>, the upper whisker does not extend to the
        last two points, which is beyond <m>Q_3 + 1.5 \times IQR</m>, and so it extends only to the last point
        below this limit. The lower whisker stops at the lowest value, 5.31%, since there is no additional data
        to reach; the lower whisker's limit is not shown in the figure because the plot does not extend down to
        <m>Q_1 - 1.5 \times IQR</m>. In a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot and the whiskers are
        like its arms trying to reach the rest of the data.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any observation lying beyond the whiskers is labeled with a dot. The purpose of labeling these points
        <mdash/> instead of extending the whiskers to the minimum and maximum observed values <mdash/> is to
        help identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data. Unusually
        distant observations are called <term>outliers</term>. In this case, it would be reasonable to classify
        the interest rates of 24.85% and 26.30% as outliers since they are numerically distant from most of the
        data.

            Two histograms are shown side by side. The first histogram has a horizontal axis of Population with
            possible data ranging from 0 to about 10 million. The first bar representing 0 to 400,000 shows a
            frequency (bar height) of about 3000, the second bar for 400,000 to 800,000 shows about frequency of
            about 100. All other bars are sufficiently small that they are virtually indistinguishable from 0. The
            second histogram shows the horizontal axis represents log-base-10 of the population. The horizontal axis
            runs from about 2 to 7, and frequency (bin/box height) peaks at a little over 1000. The data show an
            approximate bell shape, peaking in the middle between 4 to 4.5, then showing lower frequencies the
            further out from 4-4.5 with frequencies being close to zero outside of 2.5 to 6.5.

            Consider the histogram of county populations shown in <xref ref="fig-county-pop-transformed"/> (left
            panel), which shows extreme skew. What isn't useful about this plot?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Nearly all of the data fall into the left-most bin, and the extreme skew obscures many of the
            potentially interesting details in the data.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>
        There are some standard transformations that may be useful for strongly right skewed data where much of
        the data is positive but clustered near zero. A <term>transformation</term> is a rescaling of the data
        using a function. For instance, a plot of the logarithm (base 10) of county populations results in the
        new histogram in <xref ref="fig-county-pop-transformed"/> (right panel). This data is symmetric, and any
        potential outliers appear much less extreme than in the original data set. By reigning in the outliers
        and extreme skew, transformations like this often make it easier to build statistical models against the
        data.
      </p>

      <p>
        Transformations can also be applied to one or both variables in a scatterplot. A scatterplot of the
        population change from 2010 to 2017 against the population in 2010 is shown in
        <xref ref="fig-pop-change-transform"/>. In the first scatterplot, it's hard to decipher any interesting
        patterns because the population variable is so strongly skewed. However, if we apply a log<m>_{10}</m>
        transformation to the population variable, as shown in the second panel, a positive association between
        the variables is revealed.

            Two scatterplots are shown side by side. The first scatterplot has population on the horizontal axis
            (ranging from 0 to 10 million) and population change as a percent on the vertical axis (ranging from
            -35% to positive 40%). The data is particularly concentrated on the left of the graph below 1 million.
            There is no discernible trend in the data. The second scatterplot has log-base-10 of the population on
            the horizontal axis (ranging from 2 to 7) and population change as a percent on the vertical axis. The
            data is well distributed and shows a cloud of points with a slight upward trend.

      <p>
        Transformations other than the logarithm can be useful, too. For instance, the square root and inverse are
        commonly used by data scientists. Common goals in transforming data are to see the data structure
        differently, reduce skew, assist in modeling, or straighten a nonlinear relationship in a scatterplot.

        The <c>county</c> data set offers many numerical variables that we could plot using dot plots,
        scatterplots, or box plots, but these miss the true nature of the data. Rather, when we encounter
        geographic data, we should create an <term>intensity map</term>, where colors are used to show higher and

        homeownership rate (<c>homeownership</c>), and median household income (<c>median_hh_income</c>).
        The color key indicates which colors correspond to which values.
        The intensity maps are not generally very helpful for getting precise values in any given county, but

            Poverty rates are evidently higher in a few locations. Notably, the deep south shows higher poverty rates,

          <p>
            The unemployment rate follows similar trends, and we can see correspondence between the two variables. In
            fact, it makes sense for higher rates of unemployment to be closely related to poverty rates. One observation
            that stands out when comparing the two maps: the poverty rate is much higher than the unemployment rate,
            meaning while many people may be working, they are not making enough to break out of poverty.

There are no labeled axes on these plots, as only the patterns of the points in the plots are important for this exercise. In plot 1, the points are moderately clustered in the lower left corner of the plot and remain clustered looking further right in the plot, where the points follow steadily upwards to the top-right corner. In plot 2, the points appear to be scattered almost randomly all around the rectangular plotting region. Plot 3 shows points clustered tightly in the lower left corner and the data points remain clustered even as moving right, with the data trending upwards gradually and then more steeply as it reaches the right side of the plot. Plot 4, when looking on the left portion, shows data moderately clustered in the upper-left corner, which then steadily trends downward to the lower-right corner of the plot.

            Workers at a particular mining site receive an average of 35 days paid vacation, which is lower than the national average. The manager of this plant is under pressure from a local union to increase the amount of paid time off. However, he does not want to give more days off to the workers because that would be costly. Instead he decides he should fire 10 employees in such a way as to raise the average number of days off that are reported by his employees. In order to achieve this goal, should he fire employees who have the most number of days off, least number of days off, or those who have about the average number of days off?

The bins start with small bin heights on the left side, and the bin heights start increasing at about 10 and then rapidly ascend by 15 before leveling off and reaching a peak at about 22. The bins begin declining again about 24 gradually and then more rapidly around 26 to 29. At 30, the bins continue declining, but at a slower pace, before they level off near a height of 0 at about 35.

            A spatial intensity map is shown of the United States. The legend for the shading runs from values of 4 to about 33. The shading for the eastern half of the country suggests slightly higher values, while the western portion of the upper midwest (North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska) shows lower values. Other specific regions that show patterns of higher values than surrounding areas are in lower Florida and northern California.

    <title>Considering categorical data</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this section, we will introduce tables and other basic tools for categorical data that are used
        throughout this book. The <c>loan50</c> data set represents a sample from a larger loan data set called
        <c>loans</c>. This larger data set contains information on 10,000 loans made through Lending Club. We will
        examine the relationship between <c>homeownership</c>, which for the <c>loans</c> data can take a value of
        <c>rent</c>, <c>mortgage</c> (owns but has a mortgage), or <c>own</c>, and <c>app_type</c>, which
        indicates whether the loan application was made with a partner or whether it was an individual application.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <!-- Subsection 2.2.1: Contingency tables and bar plots -->
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-contingency-tables">
      <title>Contingency tables and bar plots</title>

      <p>
        <xref ref="table-loan-app-homeownership"/> summarizes two variables: <c>app_type</c> and
        <c>homeownership</c>. A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables in this way is called a
        <term>contingency table</term>. Each value in the table represents the number of times a particular
        combination of variable outcomes occurred. For example, the value 3,496 corresponds to the number of loans
        in the data set where the borrower rents their home and the application type was by an individual. Row and
        column totals are also included. The <term>row totals</term> provide the total counts across each row
        (e.g. <m>3496 + 3839 + 1170 = 8505</m>), and <term>column totals</term> are total counts down each column.
        We can also create a table that shows only the overall percentages or proportions for each combination of
        categories, or we can create a table for a single variable, such as the one shown in
        <xref ref="table-homeownership-freq"/> for the <c>homeownership</c> variable.

        A bar plot is a common way to display a single categorical variable. <xref ref="fig-homeownership-barplot"/>
        shows a <term>bar plot</term> for the <c>homeownership</c> variable. In the left panel, the bar plot shows
        counts. In the right panel, the counts are converted into proportions, showing the proportion of
        observations that are in each level (e.g. <m>3858 / 10000 = 0.3858</m> for <c>rent</c>).

            Two bar plots are shown side by side. The left bar plot has Homeownership on the horizontal axis and
            Frequency (count) on the vertical axis. Each level of homeownership has its own "bar" (which looks like
            a tall rectangle resting on the horizontal axis) with a height corresponding to the frequency of that
            bar in the data set. For example, the "Rent" bar extends from the horizontal axis up to a frequency of
            about 3900. The "Mortgage" bar extends from the horizontal axis up to about 4700, and the bar for "Own"
            extends up to about 1300. Moving to the next plot, the right bar plot, it looks very similar to the left
            bar plot except that it reports the proportion of cases on the vertical axis instead of the frequency
            (count). The values in this bar plot are: about 0.39 for Rent, about 0.47 for Mortgage, and about 0.13
            for Own.

        Sometimes it is useful to understand the fractional breakdown of one variable in another, and we can

        the <term>row proportions</term> for <xref ref="table-loan-app-homeownership"/>, which are computed as the

        <xref ref="table-col-props-app-homeownership"/> shows such a table, and here the value 0.906 indicates
        that 90.6% of renters applied as individuals for the loan. This rate is higher compared to loans from
        people with mortgages (80.2%) or who own their home (86.5%). Because these rates vary between the three
        levels of <c>homeownership</c>, this provides evidence that the <c>app_type</c> and <c>homeownership</c>

        <title>Email spam classification</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Data scientists use statistics to filter spam from incoming email messages. By noting specific
            characteristics of an email, a data scientist may be able to classify some emails as spam or not spam
            with high accuracy. One such characteristic is the email format, which indicates whether or not an
            email has any HTML content. We'll focus on email format and spam status using the <c>email</c> data
            set, and these variables are summarized in a contingency table. Which would be more helpful to someone
            hoping to classify email as spam or regular email: row or column proportions?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            A data scientist would be interested in how the proportion of spam changes within each email format.
            This corresponds to column proportions: the proportion of spam in plain text emails and the proportion
            of spam in HTML emails. If we generate the column proportions, we can see that a higher fraction of
            plain text emails are spam (17.5%) than compared to HTML emails (5.8%). This information on its own is
            insufficient to classify an email as spam or not spam, as over 80% of plain text emails are not spam.
            Yet, when we carefully combine this information with many other characteristics, we stand a reasonable
            chance of being able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with confidence.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>
        Example <xref ref="ex-spam-email-classification"/> points out that row and column proportions are not
        equivalent. Before settling on one form for a table, it is important to consider each to ensure that the most
        useful table is constructed. However, sometimes it simply isn't clear which, if either, is more useful.

            None that we thought were obvious! What is distinct about <c>app_type</c> and <c>homeownership</c> versus
            the email example is that these two variables don't have a clear explanatory-response variable relationship
            that we might hypothesize. Usually it is most useful to "condition" on the explanatory variable. For
            instance, in the email example, the email format was seen as a possible explanatory variable of whether the
            message was spam, so we would find it more interesting to compute the relative frequencies (proportions) for
            each email format.

        stacked bar plot is shown in <xref ref="fig-bar-plot-variants"/> (left panel), where we have first created
        a bar plot using the <c>homeownership</c> variable and then divided each group by the levels of
        <c>app_type</c>. One related visualization is the <term>side-by-side bar plot</term>, shown in
        <xref ref="fig-bar-plot-variants"/> (middle panel). For the last type, the column proportions have been
        translated into a standardized stacked bar plot in <xref ref="fig-bar-plot-variants"/> (right panel).
        This type of visualization is helpful in understanding the fraction of individual or joint loan
        applications for borrowers in each level of <c>homeownership</c>. Since the proportions vary across the
        groups, we can conclude that the two variables are associated.

            Three bar plots are shown side by side showing different representations of the same data. All plots
            show homeownership on the horizontal axis with levels rent, mortgage, and own. The first plot shows a
            stacked bar plot with frequency counts, the second shows bars side-by-side for each homeownership level,
            and the third shows standardized bars all reaching to 1.0 on the vertical axis.

            The stacked bar plot is most useful when it's reasonable to assign one variable as the explanatory
            variable and the other as the response. Side-by-side bar plots are more agnostic about which variable
            represents the explanatory and which the response variable. The standardized stacked bar plot is helpful
            if the primary variable is relatively imbalanced, making the simple stacked bar plot less useful for
            checking for an association. The major downside is that we lose all sense of how many cases each bar
            represents.

      <title>Mosaic plots</title>

      <p>
        A <term>mosaic plot</term> is a visualization technique suitable for contingency tables that resembles a
        standardized stacked bar plot with the benefit that we still see the relative group sizes of the primary
        variable as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        To get started in creating our first mosaic plot, we'll break a square into columns for each category of
        the <c>homeownership</c> variable. Each column represents a level of <c>homeownership</c>, and the column
        widths correspond to the proportion of loans in each of those categories. In general, mosaic plots use box
        <em>areas</em> to represent the number of cases in each category.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-mosaic-plots">
        <caption>Mosaic plots: (left) one-variable for homeownership, (right) two-variable with app_type</caption>
        <image source="ch2/loan_app_type_home_mosaic_plot/loan_app_type_home_mosaic_plot.png" width="85%">
          <description>
            Two mosaic plots are shown. The left plot shows a square divided vertically into three sections for
            rent (about 40%), mortgage (about 48%), and own (about 12%). The right plot further subdivides each
            vertical section horizontally to show the breakdown by application type (individual and joint).
          </description>
        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        To create a completed mosaic plot, the single-variable mosaic plot is further divided using the
        <c>app_type</c> variable. Each column is split proportional to the number of loans from individual and joint
        borrowers. For example, the second column represents loans where the borrower has a mortgage, and it was
        divided into individual loans (upper) and joint loans (lower). As another example, the bottom segment of the
        third column represents loans where the borrower owns their home and applied jointly, while the upper segment
        of this column represents borrowers who are homeowners and filed individually. We can again use this plot to
        see that the <c>homeownership</c> and <c>app_type</c> variables are associated, since some columns are divided
        in different vertical locations than others, which was the same technique used for checking an association in
        the standardized stacked bar plot.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the mosaic plots shown, we chose to first split by the homeowner status of the borrower. However, we could
        have instead first split by the application type. Like with the bar plots, it's common to use the explanatory
        variable to represent the first split in a mosaic plot, and then for the response to break up each level of the
        explanatory variable, if these labels are reasonable to attach to the variables under consideration.

        be useful for giving a high-level overview to show how a set of cases break down. However, it is also
        difficult to decipher details in a pie chart. For example, it takes a couple seconds longer to recognize
        that there are more loans where the borrower has a mortgage than rent when looking at the pie chart, while
        this detail is very obvious in the bar plot. While pie charts can be useful, we prefer bar plots for their

      <title>Comparing numerical data across groups</title>

      <p>
        Some of the more interesting investigations can be considered by examining numerical data across groups. The
        methods required here aren't really new: all that's required is to make a numerical plot for each group in the
        same graph. Here two convenient methods are introduced: side-by-side box plots and hollow histograms.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will take a look again at the <c>county</c> data set and compare the median household income for counties
        that gained population from 2010 to 2017 versus counties that had no gain. While we might like to make a causal
        connection here, remember that these are observational data and so such an interpretation would be, at best,
        half-baked.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were 1,454 counties where the population increased from 2010 to 2017, and there were 1,672 counties with
        no gain (all but one were a loss). A random sample of 100 counties from the first group and 50 from the second
        group are shown in <xref ref="table-county-income-by-pop-gain"/> to give a better sense of some of the raw
        median income data.

        We consider a study on a new malaria vaccine called PfSPZ. In this study, volunteer patients were randomized
        into one of two experiment groups: 14 patients received an experimental vaccine and 6 patients received a
        placebo vaccine. Nineteen weeks later, all 20 patients were exposed to a drug-sensitive malaria parasite
        strain; the motivation of using a drug-sensitive strain of parasite here is for ethical considerations,
        allowing any infections to be treated effectively. The results are summarized in
        <xref ref="table-malaria-vaccine-summary"/>, where 9 of the 14 treatment patients remained free of signs of
        infection while all of the 6 patients in the control group patients showed some baseline signs of infection.

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The study is an experiment, as patients were randomly assigned an experiment group. Since this is an
            experiment, the results can be used to evaluate a causal relationship between the malaria vaccine and
            whether patients showed signs of an infection.

      <p>
        In this study, a smaller proportion of patients who received the vaccine showed signs of an infection (35.7%
        versus 100%). However, the sample is very small, and it is unclear whether the difference provides
        <em>convincing evidence</em> that the vaccine is effective.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="ex-malaria-vaccine-convincing">
        <title>Assessing the evidence</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Data scientists are sometimes called upon to evaluate the strength of evidence. When looking at the rates
            of infection for patients in the two groups in this study, what comes to mind as we try to determine
            whether the data show convincing evidence of a real difference?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The observed infection rates (35.7% for the treatment group versus 100% for the control group) suggest the
            vaccine may be effective. However, we cannot be sure if the observed difference represents the vaccine's
            efficacy or is just from random chance. Generally there is a little bit of fluctuation in sample data, and
            we wouldn't expect the sample proportions to be <em>exactly</em> equal, even if the truth was that the
            infection rates were independent of getting the vaccine. Additionally, with such small samples, perhaps
            it's common to observe such large differences when we randomly split a group due to chance alone!
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>
        Example <xref ref="ex-malaria-vaccine-convincing"/> is a reminder that the observed outcomes in the data
        sample may not perfectly reflect the true relationships between variables since there is <term>random
        noise</term>. While the observed difference in rates of infection is large, the sample size for the study is
        small, making it unclear if this observed difference represents efficacy of the vaccine or whether it is simply
        due to chance. We label these two competing claims, <m>H_0</m> and <m>H_A</m>, which are spoken as
        "H-nought" and "H-A":
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>H_0</m>: <term>Independence model.</term> The variables <c>treatment</c> and <c>outcome</c> are
              independent. They have no relationship, and the observed difference between the proportion of patients who
              developed an infection in the two groups, 64.3%, was due to chance.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>H_A</m>: <term>Alternative model.</term> The variables are <em>not</em> independent. The difference in
              infection rates of 64.3% was not due to chance, and vaccine affected the rate of infection.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        What would it mean if the independence model, which says the vaccine had no influence on the rate of infection,
        is true? It would mean 11 patients were going to develop an infection <em>no matter which group they were
        randomized into</em>, and 9 patients would not develop an infection <em>no matter which group they were
        randomized into</em>. That is, if the vaccine did not affect the rate of infection, the difference in the
        infection rates was due to chance alone in how the patients were randomized.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now consider the alternative model: infection rates were influenced by whether a patient received the vaccine
        or not. If this was true, and especially if this influence was substantial, we would expect to see some
        difference in the infection rates of patients in the groups.
      </p>

      <p>
        We choose between these two competing claims by assessing if the data conflict so much with <m>H_0</m> that the
        independence model cannot be deemed reasonable. If this is the case, and the data support <m>H_A</m>, then we
        will reject the notion of independence and conclude the vaccine was effective.
      </p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-simulating-the-study">
      <title>Simulating the study</title>

      <p>
        We're going to implement <term>simulations</term>, where we will pretend we know that the malaria vaccine
        being tested does <em>not</em> work. Ultimately, we want to understand if the large difference we observed is
        common in these simulations. If it is common, then maybe the difference we observed was purely due to chance.
        If it is very uncommon, then the possibility that the vaccine was helpful seems more plausible.
      </p>

      <p>
        <xref ref="table-malaria-vaccine-summary"/> shows that 11 patients developed infections and 9 did not. For our
        simulation, we will suppose the infections were independent of the vaccine and we were able to <em>rewind</em>
        back to when the researchers randomized the patients in the study. If we happened to randomize the patients
        differently, we may get a different result in this hypothetical world where the vaccine doesn't influence the
        infection. Let's complete another <term>randomization</term> using a simulation.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this <term>simulation</term>, we take 20 notecards to represent the 20 patients, where we write down
        "infection" on 11 cards and "no infection" on 9 cards. In this hypothetical world, we believe each patient
        that got an infection was going to get it regardless of which group they were in, so let's see what happens if
        we randomly assign the patients to the treatment and control groups again. We thoroughly shuffle the notecards
        and deal 14 into a <em>vaccine</em> pile and 6 into a <em>placebo</em> pile. Finally, we tabulate the results,
        which are shown in <xref ref="table-malaria-vaccine-sim-1"/>.

        And another:

          <p>
            How often would you observe a difference of at least 64.3% (0.643) according to
            <xref ref="fig-malaria-rand-dot-plot"/>? Often, sometimes, rarely, or never?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            It appears that a difference of at least 64.3% due to chance alone would only happen about 2% of the time
            according to <xref ref="fig-malaria-rand-dot-plot"/>. Such a low probability indicates a rare event.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>
        The difference of 64.3% being a rare event suggests two possible interpretations of the results of the study:
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>H_0</m>: <term>Independence model.</term> The vaccine has no effect on infection rate, and we just
              happened to observe a difference that would only occur on a rare occasion.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>H_A</m>: <term>Alternative model.</term> The vaccine has an effect on infection rate, and the
              difference we observed was actually due to the vaccine being effective at combatting malaria, which
              explains the large difference of 64.3%.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on the simulations, we have two options. (1) We conclude that the study results do not provide strong
        evidence against the independence model. That is, we do not have sufficiently strong evidence to conclude the
        vaccine had an effect in this clinical setting. (2) We conclude the evidence is sufficiently strong to reject
        <m>H_0</m> and assert that the vaccine was useful. When we conduct formal studies, usually we reject the notion
        that we just happened to observe a rare event. So in this case, we reject the independence model in favor of
        the alternative. That is, we are concluding the data provide strong evidence that the vaccine provides some
        protection against malaria in this clinical setting.
      </p>

      <p>
        One field of statistics, statistical inference, is built on evaluating whether such differences are due to
        chance. In statistical inference, data scientists evaluate which model is most reasonable given the data. Errors
        do occur, just like rare events, and we might choose the wrong model. While we do not always choose correctly,
        statistical inference gives us tools to control and evaluate how often these errors occur. In Chapter 3, we give
        a formal introduction to the problem of model selection. We spend the next two chapters building a foundation of
        probability and theory necessary to make that discussion rigorous.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Rosiglitazone is the active ingredient in the controversial type 2 diabetes medicine Avandia and has been linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as stroke, heart failure, and death. A common alternative treatment is pioglitazone, the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos. In a nationwide retrospective observational study of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older, it was found that 2,593 of the 67,593 patients using rosiglitazone and 5,386 of the 159,978 using pioglitazone had serious cardiovascular problems. These data are summarized in the contingency table below.

        <title>Heart transplants</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was designated an official heart transplant candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart. Some patients got a transplant and some did not. The variable <c>transplant</c> indicates which group the patients were in; patients in the treatment group got a transplant and those in the control group did not. Of the 34 patients in the control group, 30 died. Of the 69 people in the treatment group, 45 died. Another variable called <c>survived</c> was used to indicate whether or not the patient was alive at the end of the study.

              <description>Two plots are shown, one that is a histogram and one that is a box plot, where the range of data for each is from 2.0 to 3.2. The bins for the histogram are as follows: the 2.0 to 2.2 bin has a height of 21, bin 2.2 to 2.4 a height of 6, 2.4 to 2.6 a height of 25, 2.6 to 2.8 a height of 3, 2.8 to 3.0 a height of 2, and 3.0 to 3.2 a height of 2. The box plot shows the box spanning 2.2 to 2.5, with the median line centered at 2.4. The whiskers extend from about 2.15 to 2.75. There are four points marked beyond the upper whisker at 2.9, 3.0, 3.10, and 3.15.</description>

                    <description>A side-by-side box plot is shown for marathon run times, one box plot for men and one for women. The axis for the run times spans from 2.0 to 3.2. All values described as follows are estimates. For the men box plot, the box spans 2.16 to 2.22 with the median line at 2.19. The whiskers span to 2.12 up to 2.27. There are 6 points above the upper whisker at 2.32, 2.36, 2.38, 2.44, 2.46, and 2.50. For the women box plot, the box spans from 2.44 to 2.52, with a median value of 2.46. The whiskers span from 2.41 to 2.57. There are 6 points above the upper whisker: 2.72, 2.78, 2.9, 2.92, 3.12, and 3.15.</description>

                    <description>A time series plot is shown, which in this case gives the appearance of a scatterplot. The horizontal variable is for year, which runs from 1970 to 2000, and the vertical variable is "Marathon times", which runs from 2.0 to 3.2 hours. There are two colors of points, one for men and one for women, and there is one point for men and one for women for each year. The points start at about 2.5 for men in 1970 and 2.9 for women in 1971. The points bounce around for a few years and then decline in 1975 or 1976 to 2.2 for men and 2.7 for women. The values for women decrease for a few more years to about 2.5. For the remainder of the years, the values fluctuate up or down 0.1 hours from year to year but are stable until 1999, which is the last year of data provided.</description>
