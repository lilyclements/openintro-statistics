  <title>Foundations for Inference</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Statistical inference is primarily concerned with understanding and quantifying the
      uncertainty of parameter estimates. While the equations and details change depending on
      the setting, the foundations for inference are the same throughout all of statistics.

      We start with a familiar topic: the idea of using a sample proportion to estimate
      a population proportion. Next, we create what's called a <term>confidence interval</term>,
      which is a range of plausible values where we may find the true population value.
      Finally, we introduce the <term>hypothesis testing framework</term>, which allows us to
      formally evaluate claims about the population, such as whether a survey provides strong
      evidence that a candidate has the support of a majority of the voting population.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Companies such as Pew Research frequently conduct polls as a way to understand the
        state of public opinion or knowledge on many topics, including politics, scientific
        understanding, brand recognition, and more. The ultimate goal in taking a poll is
        generally to use the responses to estimate the opinion or knowledge of the broader
        population.

      <title>Point Estimates and Error</title>
      
      <p>
        Suppose a poll suggested the US President's approval rating is 45%. We would consider
        45% to be a <term>point estimate</term> of the approval rating we might see if we
        collected responses from the entire population. This entire-population response
        proportion is generally referred to as the <term>parameter of interest</term>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When the parameter is a proportion, it is often denoted by <m>p</m>, and we often
        refer to the sample proportion as <m>\hat{p}</m> (pronounced <em>p-hat</em><fn>Not to
        be confused with <em>phat</em>, the slang term used for something cool, like this book.</fn>).
        Unless we collect responses from every individual in the population, <m>p</m> remains
        unknown, and we use <m>\hat{p}</m> as our estimate of <m>p</m>. The difference we
        observe from the poll versus the parameter is called the <term>error</term> in the
        estimate.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Generally, the error consists of two aspects: sampling error and bias.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <term>Sampling error</term>, sometimes called <em>sampling uncertainty</em>,
        describes how much an estimate will tend to vary from one sample to the next.
        For instance, the estimate from one sample might be 1% too low while in another
        it may be 3% too high. Much of statistics, including much of this book, is focused
        on understanding and quantifying sampling error, and we will find it useful to
        consider a sample's size to help us quantify this error; the <term>sample size</term>
        is often represented by the letter <m>n</m>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <term>Bias</term> describes a systematic tendency to over- or under-estimate the
        true population value. For example, if we were taking a student poll asking about
        support for a new college stadium, we'd probably get a biased estimate of the
        stadium's level of student support by wording the question as, <em>Do you support
        your school by supporting funding for the new stadium?</em> We try to minimize bias
        through thoughtful data collection procedures, which were discussed in
        Chapter 1 and are the topic of many other books.

      <title>Understanding the Variability of a Point Estimate</title>
      
      <p>
        Suppose the proportion of American adults who support the expansion of solar energy is
        <m>p = 0.88</m>, which is our parameter of interest.<fn>We haven't actually conducted
        a census to measure this value perfectly. However, a very large sample has suggested
        the actual level of support is about 88%.</fn> If we were to take a poll of 1000 American
        adults on this topic, the estimate would not be perfect, but how close might we expect
        the sample proportion in the poll would be to 88%? We want to understand, <em>how does
        the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> behave when the true population proportion is 0.88</em>.<fn>88%
        written as a proportion would be 0.88. It is common to switch between proportion and percent.
        However, formulas presented in this book always refer to the proportion, not the percent.</fn>
        Let's find out!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We can simulate responses we would get from a simple random sample of 1000 American
        adults, which is only possible because we know the actual support for expanding solar
        energy is 0.88. Here's how we might go about constructing such a simulation:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>There were about 250 million American adults in 2018. On 250 million pieces of paper,
            write <q>support</q> on 88% of them and <q>not</q> on the other 12%.</li>
        <li>Mix up the pieces of paper and pull out 1000 pieces to represent our sample of 1000
            American adults.</li>
        <li>Compute the fraction of the sample that say <q>support</q>.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        Any volunteers to conduct this simulation? Probably not. Running this simulation with
        250 million pieces of paper would be time-consuming and very costly, but we can simulate
        it using computer code; we've written a short program in <xref ref="fig-solar-poll-r-code"/>
        in case you are curious what the computer code looks like. In this simulation, the sample
        gave a point estimate of <m>\hat{p}_1 = 0.894</m>. We know the population proportion for
        the simulation was <m>p = 0.88</m>, so we know the estimate had an error of
        <m>0.894 - 0.88 = +0.014</m>.
      </p>

        One simulation isn't enough to get a great sense of the distribution of estimates we
        might expect in the simulation, so we should run more simulations. In a second simulation,
        we get <m>\hat{p}_2 = 0.885</m>, which has an error of +0.005. In another,
        <m>\hat{p}_3 = 0.878</m> for an error of -0.002. And in another, an estimate of
        <m>\hat{p}_4 = 0.859</m> with an error of -0.021. With the help of a computer, we've
        run the simulation 10,000 times and created a histogram of the results from all 10,000
        simulations in <xref ref="fig-sampling-distribution-solar"/>. This distribution of
        sample proportions is called a <term>sampling distribution</term>. We can characterize
        this sampling distribution as follows:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Center.</strong> The center of the distribution is
            <m>\bar{x}_{\hat{p}} = 0.880</m>, which is the same as the parameter. Notice that
            the simulation mimicked a simple random sample of the population, which is a
            straightforward sampling strategy that helps avoid sampling bias.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread.</strong> The standard deviation of the distribution is
            <m>s_{\hat{p}} = 0.010</m>. When we're talking about a sampling distribution or
            the variability of a point estimate, we typically use the term <term>standard error</term>
            rather than <em>standard deviation</em>, and the notation <m>SE_{\hat{p}}</m> is used
            for the standard error associated with the sample proportion.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape.</strong> The distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, and it
            <em>resembles a normal distribution</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        These findings are encouraging! When the population proportion is <m>p = 0.88</m> and
        the sample size is <m>n = 1000</m>, the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> tends to give
        a pretty good estimate of the population proportion. We also have the interesting
        observation that the histogram resembles a normal distribution.

        <title>Sampling distributions are never observed, but we keep them in mind</title>
        <p>
          In real-world applications, we never actually observe the sampling distribution, yet
          it is useful to always think of a point estimate as coming from such a hypothetical
          distribution. Understanding the sampling distribution will help us characterize and
          make sense of the point estimates that we do observe.

            If we used a much smaller sample size of <m>n = 50</m>, would you guess that

      <title>Central Limit Theorem</title>
      
      <p>
        The distribution in <xref ref="fig-sampling-distribution-solar"/> looks an awful lot
        like a normal distribution. That is no anomaly; it is the result of a general principle
        called the <term>Central Limit Theorem</term>.

      <assemblage>
        <title>Central Limit Theorem and the success-failure condition</title>
        <p>
          When observations are independent and the sample size is sufficiently large, the
          sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> will tend to follow a normal distribution with the
          following mean and standard error:
        </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>\mu_{\hat{p}} \amp= p</mrow>
          <mrow>SE_{\hat{p}} \amp= \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          In order for the Central Limit Theorem to hold, the sample size is typically
          considered sufficiently large when <m>np \geq 10</m> and <m>n(1-p) \geq 10</m>,
          which is called the <term>success-failure condition</term>.
        </p>
      </assemblage>
      
      <p>
        The Central Limit Theorem is incredibly important, and it provides a foundation for much
        of statistics. As we begin applying the Central Limit Theorem, be mindful of the two
        technical conditions: the observations must be independent, and the sample size must be
        sufficiently large such that <m>np \geq 10</m> and <m>n(1-p) \geq 10</m>.
      </p>
      
      <example xml:id="ex-confirm-clt-applies">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Earlier we estimated the mean and standard error of <m>\hat{p}</m> using simulated
            data when <m>p = 0.88</m> and <m>n = 1000</m>. Confirm that the Central Limit Theorem
            applies and the sampling distribution is approximately normal.

                <strong>Independence.</strong> There are <m>n = 1000</m> observations for each
                sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m>, and each of those observations are independent
                draws. <em>The most common way for observations to be considered independent is if
                they are from a simple random sample.</em>

            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Success-failure condition.</strong> We can confirm the sample size is
                sufficiently large by checking the success-failure condition and confirming
                the two calculated values are greater than 10:
                <md>
                  <mrow>np \amp= 1000 \times 0.88 = 880 \geq 10</mrow>

          </ol>
          <p>
            The independence and success-failure conditions are both satisfied, so the Central
            Limit Theorem applies, and it's reasonable to model <m>\hat{p}</m> using a normal
            distribution.

        <title>How to verify sample observations are independent</title>
        <p>
          Subjects in an experiment are considered independent if they undergo random assignment
          to the treatment groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the observations are from a simple random sample, then they are independent.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a sample is from a seemingly random process, e.g. an occasional error on an assembly
          line, checking independence is more difficult. In this case, use your best judgement.
        </p>
      </assemblage>
      
      <p>
        An additional condition that is sometimes added for samples from a population is that
        they are no larger than 10% of the population. When the sample exceeds 10% of the
        population size, the methods we discuss tend to overestimate the sampling error slightly
        versus what we would get using more advanced methods.<fn>For example, we could use what's
        called the <em>finite population correction factor</em>: if the sample is of size <m>n</m>
        and the population size is <m>N</m>, then we can multiply the typical standard error formula
        by <m>\sqrt{\frac{N-n}{N-1}}</m> to obtain a smaller, more precise estimate of the actual
        standard error. When <m>n &lt; 0.1 \times N</m>, this correction factor is relatively small.</fn>
        This is very rarely an issue, and when it is an issue, our methods tend to be conservative,
        so we consider this additional check as optional.

      <title>Applying the Central Limit Theorem to a real-world setting</title>
      
      <p>
        We do not actually know the population proportion unless we conduct an expensive poll of
        all individuals in the population. Our earlier value of <m>p = 0.88</m> was based on poll
        conducted by Pew Research of 1000 American adults that found <m>\hat{p} = 0.887</m>
        of them favored expanding solar energy. The researchers might have wondered: does the
        sample proportion from the poll approximately follow a normal distribution? We can check
        the conditions from the Central Limit Theorem:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Independence.</strong> The poll is a simple random sample of American adults,
            which means that the observations are independent.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Success-failure condition.</strong> To check this condition, we need the
            population proportion, <m>p</m>, to check if both <m>np</m> and <m>n(1-p)</m> are
            greater than 10. However, we do not actually know <m>p</m>, which is exactly why the
            pollsters would take a sample! In cases like these, we often use <m>\hat{p}</m> as
            our next best way to check the success-failure condition:
            <md>
              <mrow>n\hat{p} \amp= 1000 \times 0.887 = 887</mrow>
              <mrow>n(1-\hat{p}) \amp= 1000 \times (1 - 0.887) = 113</mrow>
            </md>
            The sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> acts as a reasonable substitute for <m>p</m>
            during this check, and each value in this case is well above the minimum of 10.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        This <term>substitution approximation</term> of using <m>\hat{p}</m> in place of
        <m>p</m> is also useful when computing the standard error of the sample proportion:
        <md>
          <mrow>SE_{\hat{p}} \amp= \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp\approx \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= \sqrt{\frac{0.887 \times (1 - 0.887)}{1000}}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp= 0.010</mrow>
        </md>
        This substitution technique is sometimes referred to as the <q>plug-in principle</q>.
        In this case, <m>SE_{\hat{p}}</m> didn't change enough to be detected using only 3
        decimal places versus when we completed the calculation with 0.88 earlier. The computed
        standard error tends to be reasonably stable even when observing slightly different
        proportions in one sample or another.

      <title>More details regarding the Central Limit Theorem</title>
      
      <p>
        We've applied the Central Limit Theorem in numerous examples so far this chapter:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>When observations are independent and the sample size is sufficiently large,
          the distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> resembles a normal distribution with</em>
          <md>

            <mrow>SE_{\hat{p}} \amp= \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}</mrow>

          <em>The sample size is considered sufficiently large when <m>np \geq 10</m> and
          <m>n(1-p) \geq 10</m>.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>
        In this section, we'll explore the success-failure condition and seek to better
        understand the Central Limit Theorem.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        An interesting question to answer is, <em>what happens when <m>np &lt; 10</m> or
        <m>n(1-p) &lt; 10</m>?</em> As we did in
        Section <xref ref="subsec-variability-point-estimate"/>, we can simulate drawing
        samples of different sizes where, say, the true proportion is <m>p = 0.25</m>. Here's
        a sample of size 10:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          no, no, yes, yes, no, no, no, no, no, no
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>
        In this sample, we observe a sample proportion of yeses of
        <m>\hat{p} = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2</m>. We can simulate many such proportions to
        understand the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> when <m>n = 10</m> and
        <m>p = 0.25</m>, which we've plotted in <xref ref="fig-sampling-10-prop-25p"/>
        alongside a normal distribution with the same mean and variability. These distributions
        have a number of important differences.

          <description>There are two plots. The first plot is a histogram of 10,000 simulations
          of p-hat when the sample size is n equals 10 and the population proportion is p equals
          0.25. The possible values are 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and so on up to 1.0, though the graph only
          shows values up to 0.8. The distribution is centered at about 0.25, and is slightly
          right-skewed. The frequencies are about 500 for 0.0, 1900 for 0.1, 2800 for 0.2, 2400
          for 0.3, 1500 for 0.4, 500 for 0.5, 100 for 0.6, and the bin heights for the remaining
          values have bin heights that are not visually distinguishable from zero. The second plot
          shows a normal distribution centered at 0.25 with a standard deviation of 0.137. The
          plot has a vertical line located at 0.0, which makes it more visually evident that a
          portion of the area under the normal distribution -- about 5% of this area -- represents
          values below 0.0.</description>

          distribution is centered at the proportion. Given that these are proportions based on
          relatively small sample sizes, the bins do look relatively discrete (jumpy from one to
          the next), though less so for the distributions based on n equals 25. In cases where the
          true underlying proportion is near the lower bound of 0 or the upper bound of 1, the
          distribution tends to skew away from that boundary. This is most noticeable for both the
          distributions representing proportions closer to either boundary and for the smaller
          sample size. One distribution stands out among the 10 shown: the sample with p equals
          0.5 and n equals 25, which shows a bell-shaped distribution resembling the normal
          distribution, though the data are still somewhat discrete.</description>

          0.5, 0.8, and 0.9 and 3 columns of sample sizes n equals 50, 100, and 250. Relative to
          the previous figure, which considered similar proportion scenarios but with n equals 10
          and 25, the data in these graphs looks less discrete -- that is, they appear to almost
          be continuous. This is most evident for the largest sample sizes. Nearly all of the
          graphs shown also closely resemble the normal distribution, in some cases with the larger
          sample sizes that it resembles it so closely that there are not substantial visual
          differences. One aspect less evident -- but still present -- in the last figure but that
          continues into and becomes much more obvious in this figure, is that the distributions of
          the sample proportions tend to have a much smaller standard deviation with the larger
          sample sizes. That is, the sample proportion distributions for larger sample sizes tend
          to be smaller than they were for smaller sample sizes. Also, the variability within a
          graph also appears to be largest for the proportion p equals 0.5 than it is for the other
          proportions when considering a single proportion -- and this property is apparent upon
          inspection of a distribution based on any of the considered sample sizes.</description>

        This single sampling distribution does not show that the success-failure condition is

      </p>
      
      <p>
        We can complete several additional simulations, shown in
        <xref ref="fig-clt-grid-1"/> and <xref ref="fig-clt-grid-2"/>, and we can see some
        trends:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>When either <m>np</m> or <m>n(1-p)</m> is small, the distribution is more
            <term>discrete</term>, i.e. <em>not continuous</em>.</li>
        <li>When <m>np</m> or <m>n(1-p)</m> is smaller than 10, the skew in the distribution
            is more noteworthy.</li>
        <li>The larger both <m>np</m> <em>and</em> <m>n(1-p)</m>, the more normal the
            distribution. This may be a little harder to see for the larger sample size in these
            plots as the variability also becomes much smaller.</li>
        <li>When <m>np</m> and <m>n(1-p)</m> are both very large, the distribution's
            discreteness is hardly evident, and the distribution looks much more like a normal
            distribution.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        So far we've only focused on the skew and discreteness of the distributions. We haven't
        considered how the mean and standard error of the distributions change. Take a moment to
        look back at the graphs, and pay attention to three things:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>The centers of the distribution are always at the population proportion, <m>p</m>,
            that was used to generate the simulation. Because the sampling distribution of
            <m>\hat{p}</m> is always centered at the population parameter <m>p</m>, it means
            the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> is <term>unbiased</term> when the data are
            independent and drawn from such a population.</li>
        <li>For a particular population proportion <m>p</m>, the variability in the sampling
            distribution decreases as the sample size <m>n</m> becomes larger. This will likely
            align with your intuition: an estimate based on a larger sample size will tend to be
            more accurate.</li>
        <li>For a particular sample size, the variability will be largest when <m>p = 0.5</m>.
            The differences may be a little subtle, so take a close look. This reflects the role
            of the proportion <m>p</m> in the standard error formula:
            <m>SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}</m>. The standard error is largest when
            <m>p = 0.5</m>.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        At no point will the distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> look <em>perfectly</em> normal,
        since <m>\hat{p}</m> will always take discrete values (<m>x/n</m>). It is always a
        matter of degree, and we will use the standard success-failure condition with minimums
        of 10 for <m>np</m> and <m>n(1-p)</m> as our guideline within this book.
      </p>
    </subsection>
        
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-extending-framework">
      <title>Extending the framework for other statistics</title>
      
      <p>
        The strategy of using a sample statistic to estimate a parameter is quite common, and
        it's a strategy that we can apply to other statistics besides a proportion. For instance,
        if we want to estimate the average salary for graduates from a particular college, we
        could survey a random sample of recent graduates; in that example, we'd be using a sample
        mean <m>\bar{x}</m> to estimate the population mean <m>\mu</m> for all graduates. As
        another example, if we want to estimate the difference in product prices for two websites,
        we might take a random sample of products available on both sites, check the prices on
        each, and then compute the average difference; this strategy certainly would give us some
        idea of the actual difference through a point estimate.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        While this chapter emphasizes a single proportion context, we'll encounter many different
        contexts throughout this book where these methods will be applied. The principles and
        general ideas are the same, even if the details change a little. We've also sprinkled
        some other contexts into the exercises to help you start thinking about how the ideas
        generalize.

    <title>Confidence Intervals for a Proportion</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> provides a single plausible value
        for the population proportion <m>p</m>. However, the sample proportion
        isn't perfect and will have some <em>standard error</em>
        associated with it.
        When stating an estimate for the population  proportion,
        it is better practice to provide a plausible
        <em>range of values</em> instead of supplying just the point
        estimate.

      <title>Capturing the Population Parameter</title>
      
      <p>
        Using only a point estimate is like fishing in a murky
        lake with a spear. We can throw a spear where we
        saw a fish, but we will probably miss. On the other hand,
        if we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of
        catching the fish.
        A <term>confidence interval</term> is like fishing with a net,
        and it represents a range of plausible values where we
        are likely to find the population parameter.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If we report a point estimate <m>\hat{p}</m>, we probably
        will not hit the exact population proportion. On the
        other hand, if we report a range of plausible values,
        representing a confidence interval,
        we have a good shot at capturing the parameter.

            If we want to be very certain we capture the population

            If we want to be more

      <title>Constructing a 95% Confidence Interval</title>
      
      <p>
        Our sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> is the most plausible
        value of the population proportion, so it makes sense
        to build a confidence interval around this point estimate.
        The standard error provides a guide for how
        large we should make the confidence interval.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The standard error represents the standard deviation
        of the point estimate, and when the Central
        Limit Theorem conditions are satisfied,
        the point estimate closely follows a normal distribution.
        In a normal distribution, 95% of
        the data is within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean.
        Using this principle, we can construct a confidence
        interval that extends 1.96 standard errors from the sample
        proportion to be <term>95% confident</term>
        that the interval captures the population proportion:

        process of creating 25 intervals from 25 samples

        where 24 of the resulting confidence intervals contain

      <title>Changing the Confidence Level</title>
      
      <p>
        Suppose we want to consider confidence intervals where the confidence
        level is higher than 95%, such as a confidence
        level of 99%. Think back to the analogy about trying to catch a fish:
        if we want to be more sure that we will catch the fish, we should use
        a wider net. To create a 99% confidence level, we must also widen our
        95% interval. On the other hand, if we want an interval with lower
        confidence, such as 90%, we could use a slightly narrower
        interval than our original 95% interval.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The 95% confidence interval structure provides guidance in
        how to make intervals with different confidence levels.
        The general 95% confidence interval for a point estimate
        that follows a normal distribution is

      <md>
        <mrow>\text{point estimate}\ \amp\pm\ 1.96 \times SE</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        There are three components to this interval: the point estimate,
        <q>1.96</q>, and the standard error. The choice of <m>1.96\times SE</m> was
        based on capturing 95% of the data since the estimate is within
        1.96 standard errors of the parameter about 95% of the time.
        The choice of 1.96 corresponds to a 95% confidence level.

            This is equivalent to asking how often the

            a normal distribution: 0.0049 and 0.9951.
            Thus, there is a <m>0.9951-0.0049 \approx 0.99</m> probability
            that an unobserved normal random variable

          <description>A standard normal distribution is shown, where standard is the term used to indicate that the normal distribution is centered at 0 and has a standard deviation of 1. Portions of the normal distribution have been shaded. First, the central 95% portion of the distribution has been shaded in a dark blue, and this region has an annotation stating 95%, extends from -1.96 to 1.96. Recall that the value of 1.96 closely matches our 68-95-99.7 rule for the normal distribution, which had stated that about 95% of the area under the normal distribution lied within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Second, a slightly broader region of the normal distribution is shaded, in this case from about -2.5 to positive 2.5, and this has an annotation stating, 99%, extends -2.58 to 2.58.

        This approach -- using the Z-scores in the

        For some other point estimates, a normal model is not a good fit;
        in these cases, we'll use alternative distributions that better

      <p>
        In New York City on October 23rd, 2014, a doctor who had recently been
        treating Ebola patients in Guinea went to the hospital with a slight fever
        and was subsequently diagnosed with Ebola. Soon thereafter,
        an NBC 4 New York/The Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll found that
        82% of New Yorkers favored a <q>mandatory 21-day
        quarantine for anyone who has come in contact with an Ebola
        patient</q>. This poll included responses
        of 1,042 New York adults between
        Oct 26th and 28th, 2014.
      </p>

        <statement>
          <p>
            What is the point estimate in this case,
            and is it reasonable to
            use a normal distribution to model that point estimate?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The point estimate, based on a sample of size <m>n = 1042</m>,
            is <m>\hat{p} = 0.82</m>.
            To check whether <m>\hat{p}</m> can be reasonably
            modeled using a normal distribution, we check independence
            (the poll is based on a simple random sample) and the
            success-failure condition
            (<m>1042 \times \hat{p} \approx 854</m>
            and <m>1042 \times (1 - \hat{p})
                \approx 188</m>,
            both easily greater than 10).
            With the conditions met, we are assured
            that the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> can be
            reasonably modeled using a normal distribution.

                The survey was a random sample

                so independence and the success-failure condition
                are satisfied, and
                <m>\hat{p} = 0.848</m> can be

                In this case, the point estimate is
                <m>\hat{p} = 0.848</m>.
                For a 99% confidence interval, <m>z^{\star} = 2.58</m>.
                Computing the standard error:
                <m>SE_{\hat{p}}
                  = \sqrt{\frac{0.848(1 - 0.848)}
                      {1000}}
                  = 0.0114</m>.
                Finally, we compute the interval as
                <m>0.848 \pm 2.58 \times 0.0114
                  \to (0.8186,   0.8774)</m>.
                It is also important to <em>always</em> provide an interpretation
                for the interval: we are 99% confident the proportion of
                American adults that support expanding the use of wind
                turbines in 2018 is between 81.9% and 87.7%.

        We can also construct confidence intervals for other
        parameters, such as a population mean.
        In these cases, a confidence interval would be computed
        in a similar way to that of a single proportion:
        a point estimate plus/minus some margin of error.
        We'll dive into these details in later chapters.

      <title>Interpreting Confidence Intervals</title>
      
      <p>
        In each of the examples, we described the confidence
        intervals by putting them into the context of the data and also
        using somewhat formal language:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Solar.</title>
          <p>
            We are 90% confident that 87.1% to 90.4% of
            American adults support the expansion of solar power in 2018.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Ebola.</title>
          <p>
            We are 95% confident that the proportion
            of New York adults in October 2014 who supported a quarantine
            for anyone who had come into contact with an Ebola patient was
            between 0.796 and 0.844.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Wind Turbine.</title>
          <p>
            We are 99% confident the proportion of
            Americans adults that support expanding the use of wind
            turbines is between 81.9% and 87.7% in 2018.
          </p>
        </li>
      </dl>
      <p>
        First, notice that the statements are always about the population
        parameter, which considers <em>all</em> American adults for the
        energy polls or <em>all</em> New York adults for the quarantine poll.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We also avoided another common mistake:
        <em>incorrect</em> language might try to describe the confidence interval
        as capturing the population parameter with a certain probability.
        Making a probability interpretation is a common error:
        while it might be useful to think of it as a probability,
        the confidence level only quantifies how plausible
        it is that the parameter is in the given interval.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Another important consideration of confidence intervals is that they
        are <em>only about the population parameter</em>.
        A confidence interval says nothing about individual
        observations or point estimates.
        Confidence intervals only provide a plausible range for
        population parameters.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Lastly, keep in mind the methods we discussed only apply
        to sampling error, not to bias.
        If a data set is collected in a way that will tend to
        systematically under-estimate
        (or over-estimate) the population parameter, the techniques
        we have discussed will not address that problem.
        Instead, we rely on careful data collection procedures to
        help protect against bias in the examples we have considered,
        which is a common practice employed by data scientists
        to combat bias.

            90% confident that the new survey's proportion
            will be between 87.1% and 90.4%?

            about 1.2%, and a normal model may reasonably be used in this setting. Create

    <title>Hypothesis Testing for a Proportion</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The following question comes from a book written by
        Hans Rosling, Anna Rosling Rönnlund, and Ola Rosling
        called <em>Factfulness</em>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Write down what your answer (or guess),
        and when you're ready, find the answer in the

        80% of the world's 1 year olds have been vaccinated
        against some disease.</fn>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In this section,
        we'll be exploring how people with a 4-year college
        degree perform on this and other world health questions
        as we learn about hypothesis tests, which are
        a framework used to rigorously evaluate competing
        ideas and claims.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-ht-framework">
      <title>Hypothesis testing framework</title>
      
      <p>
        We're interested in understanding how much people know
        about world health and development.
        If we take a multiple choice
        world health question, then we might like to understand if
      </p>
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title><m>\mathbf{H_0}</m>:</title>
          <p>
            People never learn these particular topics and their
            responses are simply equivalent to random guesses.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title><m>\mathbf{H_A}</m>:</title>
          <p>
            People have knowledge that helps them do better
            than random guessing, or perhaps, they have false knowledge
            that leads them to actually do worse than random guessing.
          </p>
        </li>
      </dl>
      <p>
        These competing ideas are called <term>hypotheses</term>.
        We call <m>H_0</m> the null hypothesis and <m>H_A</m> the alternative
        hypothesis.
        When there is a subscript 0 like in <m>H_0</m>,
        data scientists pronounce it as <q>nought</q>
        (e.g. <m>H_0</m> is pronounced <q>H-nought</q>).
      </p>
      
      <assemblage xml:id="def-null-alternative-hypotheses">
        <title>Null and alternative hypotheses</title>
        <p>
          The <term>null hypothesis (<m>H_0</m>)</term> often represents
          a skeptical perspective or a claim to be tested.
          The <term>alternative hypothesis (<m>H_A</m>)</term> represents an
          alternative claim under consideration and is often
          represented by a range of possible parameter values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our job as data scientists is to play the role of a skeptic:
          before we buy into the alternative hypothesis, we need to
          see strong supporting evidence.
        </p>
      </assemblage>
      
      <p>
        The null hypothesis often represents a skeptical position
        or a perspective of <q>no difference</q>.
        In our first example, we'll consider whether
        the typical person does any different than random guessing
        on Roslings' question about infant vaccinations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The alternative hypothesis generally represents a new
        or stronger perspective. In the case of the question
        about infant vaccinations,
        it would certainly be interesting to learn whether
        people do better than random guessing, since that would
        mean that the typical person knows something about
        world health statistics.
        It would also be very interesting if we learned
        that people do <em>worse</em> than random guessing,
        which would suggest people believe
        incorrect information about world health.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The hypothesis testing framework is a very general tool, and we often use it without a second thought. If a person makes a somewhat unbelievable claim, we are initially skeptical. However, if there is sufficient evidence that supports the claim, we set aside our skepticism and reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. The hallmarks of hypothesis testing are also found in the US court system.
      </p>
      
      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A US court considers two possible claims about a defendant: she is either innocent or guilty. If we set these claims up in a hypothesis framework, which would be the null hypothesis and which the alternative?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The jury considers whether the evidence is so
            convincing (strong) that there is no reasonable doubt
            regarding the person's guilt;
            in such a case, the jury rejects innocence
            (the null hypothesis) and concludes the defendant
            is guilty (alternative hypothesis).
          </p>
        </solution>
      </exercise>
      
      <p>
        Jurors examine the evidence to see whether it convincingly
        shows a defendant is guilty.
        Even if the jurors leave unconvinced of guilt beyond
        a reasonable doubt, this does not mean they believe the
        defendant is innocent.
        This is also the case with hypothesis testing:
        <em>even if we fail to reject the null hypothesis,
        we typically do not accept the null hypothesis as true</em>.
        Failing to find strong evidence for the alternative
        hypothesis is not equivalent to accepting
        the null hypothesis.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When considering Roslings' question about infant vaccination,
        the null hypothesis represents the notion that the people
        we will be considering -- college-educated adults --
        are as accurate as random guessing.
        That is, the proportion
        <m>p</m> of respondents who pick the correct
        answer, that 80% of 1 year olds have been vaccinated
        against some disease, is about 33.3%
        (or 1-in-3 if wanting to be perfectly precise).
        The alternative hypothesis is that this proportion is something
        other than 33.3%. While it's helpful to write these hypotheses
        in words, it can be useful to write them using mathematical
        notation:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title><m>H_0</m>:</title>
          <p><m>p = 0.333</m></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title><m>H_A</m>:</title>
          <p><m>p \neq 0.333</m></p>
        </li>
      </dl>
      <p>
        In this hypothesis setup, we want to make a conclusion about
        the population parameter <m>p</m>. The value we are comparing the
        parameter to is called the <term>null value</term>, which in this
        case is 0.333. It's common to label the null value with the
        same symbol as the parameter but with a subscript `0'.
        That is, in this case, the null value is <m>p_0 = 0.333</m>
        (pronounced <q>p-nought equals 0.333</q>).
      </p>
      
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            It may seem impossible that the
            proportion of people who get the correct answer
            is <em>exactly</em> 33.3%. If we don't believe the
            null hypothesis, should we simply reject it?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            No. While we may not buy into the notion that
            the proportion is exactly 33.3%, the hypothesis testing
            framework requires that there be strong evidence before
            we reject the null hypothesis and conclude something
            more interesting.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            After all, even if we don't believe the proportion is
            <em>exactly</em> 33.3%, that doesn't really tell us anything
            useful! We would still be stuck with the original question:
            do people do better or worse than random guessing on
            Roslings' question?
            Without data that strongly
            points in one direction or the other, it is both
            uninteresting and pointless to reject <m>H_0</m>.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      
      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Another example of a real-world hypothesis testing situation
            is evaluating whether a new drug is better or worse
            than an existing drug at treating a particular disease.
            What should we use for the null and alternative hypotheses in
            this case?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The null hypothesis (<m>H_0</m>) in this case is
            the declaration of <em>no difference</em>: the drugs are equally
            effective. The alternative hypothesis (<m>H_A</m>) is that the
            new drug performs differently than the original,
            i.e. it could perform better or worse.

      <p>
        We will use the Rosling responses
        data set to evaluate
        the hypothesis test evaluating whether college-educated adults
        who get the question about infant vaccination correct is different
        from 33.3%.
        This data set summarizes the answers of 50
        college-educated adults.
        Of these 50 adults, 24% of
        respondents got the question correct that 80% of 1 year olds
        have been vaccinated against some disease.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Up until now, our discussion has been philosophical.
        However, now that we have data, we might ask ourselves:
        does the data provide strong evidence that the proportion
        of all college-educated adults who would answer this
        question correctly is different than 33.3%?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We learned in <xref ref="sec-point-estimates"/> that there is
        fluctuation from one sample to another, and it is unlikely
        that our sample proportion, <m>\hat{p}</m>,
        will exactly equal <m>p</m>, but we want to make
        a conclusion about <m>p</m>.
        We have a nagging concern:
        is this deviation of 24%
        from 33.3% simply due to chance,
        or does the data provide strong evidence that the
        population proportion is different from 33.3%?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In <xref ref="sec-confidence-intervals"/>, we learned how to
        quantify the uncertainty in our estimate using confidence
        intervals.
        The same method for measuring variability can be useful
        for the hypothesis test.
      </p>
      
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Check whether it is reasonable to construct
            a confidence interval for <m>p</m> using the sample data, and
            if so, construct a 95% confidence interval.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The conditions are met for <m>\hat{p}</m> to be approximately
            normal: the data come from a simple random sample (satisfies
            independence), and <m>n\hat{p} = 12</m> and
            <m>n(1 - \hat{p}) = 38</m> are both
            at least 10 (success-failure condition).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To construct the confidence interval, we will need to identify
            the point estimate (<m>\hat{p} = 0.24</m>),
            the critical value for
            the 95% confidence level (<m>z^{\star} = 1.96</m>), and the standard

            We are 95% confident that the proportion of all
            college-educated adults to correctly answer this

            12.2% and 35.8%.

        Because the null value in the hypothesis test is <m>p_0 = 0.333</m>,
        which falls within the range of plausible values from the
        confidence interval, we cannot say the null value is
        implausible.<fn>Arguably this method is slightly imprecise.
        As we'll see in a few pages, the standard error is often
        computed slightly differently in the context of a hypothesis
        test for a proportion.</fn>
        That is, the data do not provide sufficient evidence to reject
        the notion that the performance of college-educated
        adults was different than random guessing,
        and we do not reject the null hypothesis, <m>H_0</m>.

        <p>
          In many statistical explanations, we use double negatives.
          For instance, we might say that the null hypothesis is
          <em>not implausible</em> or we <em>failed to reject</em>
          the null hypothesis.
          Double negatives are used to communicate that while we
          are not rejecting a position, we are also not saying it
          is correct.

              <em>There are 2 billion children in the world today
              aged 0-15 years old, how many children will there

          <p>
            Set up appropriate hypotheses to evaluate whether
            college-educated adults are better than random guessing
            on this question.
            Also, see if you can guess the correct answer before checking
            the answer in the solution!

        </statement>
        <solution>

            The appropriate hypotheses are:

          <p>
            <m>H_0</m>: the proportion who get the answer correct is the same
            as random guessing: 1-in-3, or <m>p = 0.333</m>.

          </p>
          <p>
            The correct answer to the question is 2 billion.
            While the world population is projected to increase,
            the average age is also expected to rise.
            That is, the majority of the population growth will
            happen in older age groups, meaning people are projected

            Because the null value, <m>p_0 = 0.333</m>, is not in the
            confidence interval, a population proportion of 0.333
            is implausible and we reject the null hypothesis.
            That is, the data provide statistically significant
            evidence that the actual proportion of college adults
            who get the children-in-2100 question correct is
            different from random guessing. Because the entire
            95% confidence interval
            is below 0.333, we can conclude college-educated adults
            do <em>worse</em> than random guessing on this question.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            One subtle consideration is that we used a
            95% confidence interval.
            What if we had used a 99% confidence level?
            Or even a 99.9% confidence level?
            It's possible to come to a different conclusion
            if using a different confidence level.
            Therefore, when we make a conclusion based
            on confidence interval, we should also be sure
            it is clear what confidence level we used.

      <p>
        The worse-than-random performance on this
        last question is not a fluke:
        there are many such world health questions where people
        do worse than random guessing.
        In general, the answers suggest that people tend to be
        more pessimistic about progress than reality suggests.
        This topic is discussed in much greater detail in

        Hypothesis tests are not flawless: we can make an incorrect
        decision in a statistical hypothesis test based on the data.
        For example, in the court system innocent people are
        sometimes wrongly convicted and the guilty sometimes walk free.
        One key distinction with statistical hypothesis tests is that
        we have the tools necessary to probabilistically quantify how
        often we make errors in our conclusions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Recall that there are two competing hypotheses:
        the null and the alternative.
        In a hypothesis test, we make a statement about which one might
        be true, but we might choose incorrectly. There are four possible
        scenarios, which are summarized in <xref ref="table-decision-errors"/>.

            doubt</q> to <q>beyond a little doubt</q>. Lowering the bar
            for guilt will also result in more wrongful convictions,

      <p>
        The previous exercises provide
        an important lesson: if we reduce how often we make

        other type.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Hypothesis testing is built around rejecting or failing
        to reject the null hypothesis.
        That is, we do not reject <m>H_0</m> unless we have strong evidence.
        But what precisely does <em>strong evidence</em> mean?
        As a general rule of thumb, for those cases where the null
        hypothesis is actually true, we do not want to incorrectly
        reject <m>H_0</m> more than 5% of the time.
        This corresponds to a <term>significance level</term>
        of 0.05.
        That is, if the null hypothesis is true,
        the significance level indicates how often
        the data lead us to incorrectly reject <m>H_0</m>.
        We often write the significance level using <m>\alpha</m>
        (the Greek letter <em>alpha</em>):
        <m>\alpha = 0.05</m>.
        We discuss the appropriateness of different significance
        levels in <xref ref="subsec-significance-level"/>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If we use a 95% confidence interval to evaluate a
        hypothesis test and the null hypothesis happens to be true,
        we will make an error whenever the point estimate is
        at least 1.96 standard errors away from the population
        parameter.
        This happens about 5% of the time (2.5% in each tail).
        Similarly, using a 99% confidence interval to evaluate
        a hypothesis is equivalent to a significance level of
        <m>\alpha = 0.01</m>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A confidence interval is very helpful in determining
        whether or not to reject the null hypothesis.
        However, the confidence interval approach isn't always
        sustainable.
        In several sections, we will encounter situations where
        a confidence interval cannot be constructed.
        For example, if we wanted to evaluate the hypothesis
        that several proportions are equal, it isn't clear how
        to construct and compare many confidence intervals
        altogether.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Next we will introduce a statistic called the <em>p-value</em>
        to help us expand our statistical toolkit, which will
        enable us to both better understand the strength of
        evidence and work in more complex data scenarios in
        later sections.

        The p-value is a way of quantifying the strength of the evidence against the null
        hypothesis and in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Statistical hypothesis

            Pew Research asked a random sample of 1000 American adults whether they
            supported the increased usage of coal to produce energy. Set up hypotheses to

            coal. If <m>p</m> represents the proportion supporting, then we can write the
            hypotheses as
            <md>
              <mrow>H_0: \amp\  p = 0.5</mrow>
              <mrow>H_A: \amp\  p \neq 0.5</mrow>
            </md>
            In this case, the null value is <m>p_0 = 0.5</m>.

        When evaluating hypotheses for proportions using the p-value method, we will
        slightly modify how we check the success-failure condition and compute the
        standard error for the single proportion case. These changes aren't dramatic, but
        pay close attention to how we use the null value, <m>p_0</m>.

            Pew Research's sample show that 37% of American adults support increased usage
            of coal. We now wonder, does 37% represent a real difference from the null
            hypothesis of 50%? What would the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> look
            like if the null hypothesis were true?

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            If the null hypothesis were true, the population proportion would be the null
            value, 0.5. We previously learned that the sampling distribution of
            <m>\hat{p}</m> will be normal when two conditions are met:

                <p>
                  Based on the poll's sample size of <m>n = 1000</m>, the success-failure
                  condition is met, since
                  <md>
                    <mrow>np ~ \stackrel{H_0}{=} ~ 1000 \times 0.5 = 500 \qquad\qquad

                  are both at least 10. Note that the success-failure condition was
                  checked using the null value, <m>p_0 = 0.5</m>; this is the first
                  procedural difference from confidence intervals.

          </p>
          <p>
            If the null hypothesis were true, the sampling distribution indicates that a
            sample proportion based on <m>n = 1000</m> observations would be normally
            distributed. Next, we can compute the standard error, where we will again use
            the null value <m>p_0 = 0.5</m> in the calculation:
            <me>
              SE_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \quad \stackrel{H_0}{=} \quad
              \sqrt{\frac{0.5 \times (1-0.5)}{1000}} = 0.016
            </me>
            This marks the other procedural difference from confidence intervals: since
            the sampling distribution is determined under the null proportion, the null
            value <m>p_0</m> was used for the proportion in the calculation rather than
            <m>\hat{p}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, if the null hypothesis were true, then the sample proportion
            should follow a normal distribution with mean 0.5 and a standard error of
            0.016. This distribution is shown in <xref ref="fig-coal-null-distribution"/>.

        <p>
          When using the p-value method to evaluate a hypothesis test, we check the
          conditions for <m>\hat{p}</m> and construct the standard error using the null
          value, <m>p_0</m>, instead of using the sample proportion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a hypothesis test with a p-value, we are supposing the null hypothesis is
          true, which is a different mindset than when we compute a confidence interval.
          This is why we use <m>p_0</m> instead of <m>\hat{p}</m> when we check

      <p>
        When we identify the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, it has a

        probability of the observed <m>\hat{p}</m>, or a <m>\hat{p}</m> that is more
        extreme, if the null hypothesis were true. To find the p-value, we generally find
        the null distribution, and then we find a tail area in that distribution
        corresponding to our point estimate.

            <m>\hat{p}</m> at least as far into the tails as 0.37 under the null

        <solution>
          <p>
            This is a normal probability problem where <m>x = 0.37</m>. First, we draw a
            simple graph to represent the situation, similar to what is shown in <xref
            ref="fig-coal-null-distribution"/>. Since <m>\hat{p}</m> is so far out in the
            tail, we know the tail area is going to be very small. To find it, we start by
            computing the Z-score using the mean of 0.5 and the standard error of 0.016:
            <me>Z = \frac{0.37 - 0.5}{0.016} = -8.125</me>
          </p>
          <p>
            We can use software to find the tail area: <m>2.2 \times 10^{-16}</m>
            (0.00000000000000022). If using the normal probability table in the appendix,
            we'd find that <m>Z = -8.125</m> is off the table, so we would use the
            smallest area listed: 0.0002.
          </p>
          <p>
            The potential <m>\hat{p}</m>'s in the upper tail beyond 0.63, which are shown
            in <xref ref="fig-coal-p-value-both-tails"/>, also represent observations at
            least as extreme as the observed value of 0.37. To account for these values
            that are also more extreme under the hypothesis setup, we double the lower tail
            to get an estimate of the p-value: <m>4.4 \times 10^{-16}</m> (or if using the
            table method, 0.0004).

            If the null hypothesis were true, there's only an incredibly small chance of

            <ol>
              <li>The null hypothesis is true, and we just happened to observe something so

          <p>
            Formally, when we evaluate a hypothesis test, we compare the p-value to the

      <title>Choosing a Significance Level</title>
      
      <p>
        Choosing a significance level for a test is important in many contexts,
        and the traditional level is <m>\alpha = 0.05</m>.
        However, it can be helpful to adjust the significance level based on the application.
        We may select a level that is smaller or larger than 0.05 depending on the
        consequences of any conclusions reached from the test.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If making a Type 1 Error is dangerous or especially costly,
        we should choose a small significance level (e.g. 0.01).
        Under this scenario we want to be very cautious about rejecting the null hypothesis,
        so we demand very strong evidence favoring <m>H_A</m> before we would reject <m>H_0</m>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If a Type 2 Error is relatively more dangerous or much more costly than a Type 1 Error,
        then we might choose a higher significance level (e.g. 0.10).
        Here we want to be cautious about failing to reject <m>H_0</m> when the alternative
        hypothesis is actually true.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Additionally, if the cost of collecting data is small relative to the cost of a
        Type 2 Error, then it may also be a good strategy to collect more data.
        Under this strategy, the Type 2 Error can be reduced while not affecting the
        Type 1 Error rate.
        Of course, collecting extra data is often costly, so there is typically a
        cost-benefit analysis to be considered.

        When the sample size becomes larger, point estimates become more precise and any
        real differences in the mean and null value become easier to detect and
        recognize. Even a very small difference would likely be detected if we took a

      </p>

      <p>
        For example, an online experiment might identify that placing additional ads on a
        movie review website statistically significantly increases viewership of a TV
        show by 0.001%, but this increase might not have any practical value.

      <p>
        One role of a data scientist in conducting a study often includes planning the
        size of the study. The data scientist might first consult experts or scientific
        literature to learn what would be the smallest meaningful difference from the
        null value. She also would obtain other information, such as a very rough
        estimate of the true proportion <m>p</m>, so that she could roughly estimate the
        standard error. From here, she can suggest a sample size that is sufficiently
        large that, if there is a real difference that is meaningful, we could detect it.
        While larger sample sizes may still be used, these calculations are especially
        helpful when considering costs or potential risks, such as possible health
        impacts to volunteers in a medical study.

      <title>One-Sided Hypothesis Tests (Special Topic)</title>

      <p>
        So far we've only considered what are called <term>two-sided hypothesis
        tests</term>, where we care about detecting whether <m>p</m> is either above or
        below some null value <m>p_0</m>. There is a second type of hypothesis test
        called a <term>one-sided hypothesis test</term>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a one-sided hypothesis test, the hypotheses take one of the following forms:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>There's only value in detecting if the population parameter is
            <em>less than</em> some value <m>p_0</m>. In this case, the alternative
            hypothesis is written as <m>p &lt; p_0</m> for some null value <m>p_0</m>.</li>
        <li>There's only value in detecting if the population parameter is
            <em>more than</em> some value <m>p_0</m>: In this case, the alternative
            hypothesis is written as <m>p &gt; p_0</m>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        While we adjust the form of the alternative hypothesis, we continue to write the
        null hypothesis using an equals-sign in the one-sided hypothesis test case.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the entire hypothesis testing procedure, there is only one difference in
        evaluating a one-sided hypothesis test vs a two-sided hypothesis test: how to
        compute the p-value. In a one-sided hypothesis test, we compute the p-value as
        the tail area in the <em>direction of the alternative hypothesis only</em>,
        meaning it is represented by a single tail area. Herein lies the reason why
        one-sided tests are sometimes interesting: if we don't have to double the tail
        area to get the p-value, then the p-value is smaller and the level of evidence
        required to identify an interesting finding in the direction of the alternative
        hypothesis goes down. However, one-sided tests aren't all sunshine and rainbows:
        the heavy price paid is that any interesting findings in the opposite direction
        must be disregarded.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="ex-stents-two-sided-important">
        <statement>
          <p>
            In Section <xref ref="subsec-ht-framework"/>, we encountered an example where
            doctors were interested in determining whether stents would help people who
            had a high risk of stroke. The researchers believed the stents would help.
            Unfortunately, the data showed the opposite: patients who received stents
            actually did worse. Why was using a two-sided test so important in this
            context?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Before the study, researchers had reason to believe that stents would help
            patients since existing research suggested stents helped in patients with
            heart attacks. It would surely have been tempting to use a one-sided test in
            this situation, and had they done this, they would have limited their ability
            to identify potential harm to patients.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>
        This example highlights that using a one-sided hypothesis creates a risk of
        overlooking data supporting the opposite conclusion. We could have made a similar
        error when reviewing the Roslings' question data in this section; if we had a
        pre-conceived notion that college-educated people wouldn't do worse than random
        guessing and so used a one-sided test, we would have missed the really
        interesting finding that many people have incorrect knowledge about global public
        health.
      </p>

      <p>
        When might a one-sided test be appropriate to use? <em>Very rarely.</em> Should
        you ever find yourself considering using a one-sided test, carefully answer the
        following question:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>What would I, or others, conclude if the data happens to go clearly in the
          opposite direction than my alternative hypothesis?</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        If you or others would find any value in making a conclusion about the data that
        goes in the opposite direction of a one-sided test, then a two-sided hypothesis
        test should actually be used. These considerations can be subtle, so exercise
        caution. We will only apply two-sided tests in the rest of this book.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="ex-why-not-choose-direction-after">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Why can't we simply run a one-sided test that goes in the direction of the
            data?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We've been building a careful framework that controls for the Type 1 Error,
            which is the significance level <m>\alpha</m> in a hypothesis test. We'll use
            the <m>\alpha = 0.05</m> below to keep things simple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine we could pick the one-sided test after we saw the data. What will go
            wrong?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If <m>\hat{p}</m> is <em>smaller</em> than the null value, then a
                one-sided test where <m>p &lt; p_0</m> would mean that any observation in
                the <em>lower</em> 5% tail of the null distribution would lead to us
                rejecting <m>H_0</m>.</li>
            <li>If <m>\hat{p}</m> is <em>larger</em> than the null value, then a
                one-sided test where <m>p &gt; p_0</m> would mean that any observation in
                the <em>upper</em> 5% tail of the null distribution would lead to us
                rejecting <m>H_0</m>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Then if <m>H_0</m> were true, there's a 10% chance of being in one of the two
            tails, so our testing error is actually <m>\alpha = 0.10</m>, not 0.05. That
            is, not being careful about when to use one-sided tests effectively
            undermines the methods we're working so hard to develop and utilize.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <warning>
        <p>
          Use one-sided tests only when you have a strong reason to care about
          deviations in only one direction. If you're unsure, use a two-sided test.
