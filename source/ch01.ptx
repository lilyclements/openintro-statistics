  <title>Introduction to data</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful observations.
      These observations<mdash />collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and 
      experiments<mdash />form the backbone of a statistical investigation and are called 
      <term>data</term>. Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw 
      conclusions from data, and in this first chapter, we focus on both the properties of 
      data and on the collection of data.

    <title>Case study: using stents to prevent strokes</title>
    <idx>stroke</idx>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        This section introduces a classic challenge in statistics: evaluating the efficacy of 
        a medical treatment. Terms in this section, and indeed much of this chapter, will all 
        be revisited later in the text. The plan for now is simply to get a sense of the role 
        statistics can play in practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this section we will consider an experiment that studies effectiveness of stents in 
        treating patients at risk of stroke. Stents are devices put inside blood vessels that 
        assist in patient recovery after cardiac events and reduce the risk of an additional 
        heart attack or death. Many doctors have hoped that there would be similar benefits for 
        patients at risk of stroke. We start by writing the principal question the researchers 
        hope to answer:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Does the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke?
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The researchers who asked this question conducted an experiment with 451 at-risk patients. 
        Each volunteer patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups:
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Treatment group</term>. Patients in the treatment group received a stent and 
              medical management. The medical management included medications, management of risk 
              factors, and help in lifestyle modification.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Control group</term>. Patients in the control group received the same medical 
              management as the treatment group, but they did not receive stents.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Researchers randomly assigned 224 patients to the treatment group and 227 to the control 
        group. In this study, the control group provides a reference point against which we can 
        measure the medical impact of stents in the treatment group.
      </p>

      <p>
        Researchers studied the effect of stents at two time points: 30 days after enrollment and 
        365 days after enrollment. The results of 5 patients are summarized in 
        <xref ref="table-stent-study-results-df"/>. Patient outcomes are recorded as 
        <q>stroke</q> or <q>no event</q>, representing whether or not the patient had a stroke 
        at the end of a time period.

      Considering data from each patient individually would be a long, cumbersome path towards 
      answering the original research question. Instead, performing a statistical data analysis 
      allows us to consider all of the data at once. <xref ref="table-stent-study-results"/> 
      summarizes the raw data in a more helpful way. In this table, we can quickly see what 
      happened over the entire study. For instance, to identify the number of patients in the 
      treatment group who had a stroke within 30 days, we look on the left-side of the table at 
      the intersection of the treatment and stroke: 33.

      <title>Computing proportions from the stent study</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Of the 224 patients in the treatment group, 45 had a stroke by the end of the first 
          year. Using these two numbers, compute the proportion of patients in the treatment 
          group who had a stroke by the end of their first year.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The proportion of the 224 patients who had a stroke within 365 days: 
          <m>45/224 = 0.20</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      We can compute summary statistics from the table. A <term>summary statistic</term> is a 
      single number summarizing a large amount of data. For instance, the primary results of 
      the study after 1 year could be described by two summary statistics: the proportion of 
      people who had a stroke in the treatment and control groups.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Proportion who had a stroke in the treatment (stent) group: 
            <m>45/224 = 0.20 = 20\%</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Proportion who had a stroke in the control group: <m>28/227 = 0.12 = 12\%</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      These two summary statistics are useful in looking for differences in the groups, and we 
      are in for a surprise: an additional 8% of patients in the treatment group had a stroke! 
      This is important for two reasons. First, it is contrary to what doctors expected, which 
      was that stents would <em>reduce</em> the rate of strokes. Second, it leads to a 
      statistical question: do the data show a <q>real</q> difference between the groups?
    </p>

    <p>
      This second question is subtle. Suppose you flip a coin 100 times. While the chance a coin 
      lands heads in any given coin flip is 50%, we probably won't observe exactly 50 heads. This 
      type of fluctuation is part of almost any type of data generating process. It is possible 
      that the 8% difference in the stent study is due to this natural variation. However, the 
      larger the difference we observe (for a particular sample size), the less believable it is 
      that the difference is due to chance. So what we are really asking is the following: is 
      the difference so large that we should reject the notion that it was due to chance?
    </p>

    <p>
      While we don't yet have our statistical tools to fully address this question on our own, 
      we can comprehend the conclusions of the published analysis: there was compelling evidence 
      of harm by stents in this study of stroke patients.
    </p>

    <warning>
      <title>Be careful</title>
      <p>
        Do not generalize the results of this study to all patients and all stents. This study 
        looked at patients with very specific characteristics who volunteered to be a part of 
        this study and who may not be representative of all stroke patients. In addition, there 
        are many types of stents and this study only considered the self-expanding Wingspan stent 
        (Boston Scientific). However, this study does leave us with an important lesson: we 
        should keep our eyes open for surprises.

        <statement>
          <p>
            A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish 
            to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, 
            researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with 
            migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 
            43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed 
            to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture 
            (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received 
            acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the 
            contingency table below.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Effective organization and description of data is a first step in most analyses. This 
        section introduces the <em>data matrix</em> for organizing data as well as some 
        terminology about different forms of data that will be used throughout this book.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-observations-variables">

      <idx>loan50 data</idx>

      <p>
        <xref ref="table-loan50-df"/> displays rows 1, 2, 3, and 50 of a data set for 50 
        randomly sampled loans offered through Lending Club, which is a peer-to-peer lending 
        company. These observations will be referred to as the <c>loan50</c> data set.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each row in the table represents a single loan. The formal name for a row is a 
        <term>case</term> or <term>observational unit</term>. The columns represent 
        characteristics, called <term>variables</term>, for each of the loans. For example, 
        the first row represents a loan of $22,000 with an interest rate of 10.90%, 
        where the borrower is based in New Jersey (NJ) and has an income of $59,000.

        <title>Reading data from a data matrix</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            What is the grade of the first loan in <xref ref="table-loan50-df"/>? And what is 
            the home ownership status of the borrower for that first loan?

      <p>
        In practice, it is especially important to ask clarifying questions to ensure important 
        aspects of the data are understood. For instance, it is always important to be sure we 
        know what each variable means and the units of measurement. Descriptions of the 
        <c>loan50</c> variables are given in <xref ref="table-loan50-variables"/>.

      <p>
        The data in <xref ref="table-loan50-df"/> represent a <term>data matrix</term>, which 
        is a convenient and common way to organize data, especially if collecting data in a 
        spreadsheet. Each row of a data matrix corresponds to a unique case (observational unit), 
        and each column corresponds to a variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        When recording data, use a data matrix unless you have a very good reason to use a 
        different structure. This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables 
        as new columns.
      </p>

      <exercise xml:id="guided-practice-gradebook">
        <title>Organizing a gradebook</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The grades for assignments, quizzes, and exams in a course are often recorded in a 
            gradebook that takes the form of a data matrix. How might you organize grade data 
            using a data matrix?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            There are multiple strategies that can be followed. One common strategy is to have 
            each student represented by a row, and then add a column for each assignment, quiz, 
            or exam. Under this setup, it is easy to review a single line to understand a 
            student's grade history. There should also be columns to include student information, 
            such as one column to list student names.

        <title>Organizing county data</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <idx>county data</idx>
            We consider data for 3,142 counties in the United States. The data includes each county's 
            name, the state where it resides, its population in 2017, how its population changed from 
            2010 to 2017, poverty rate, and six additional characteristics.
            How might the county data described above be organized in a data matrix?

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Each county may be viewed as a case, and there are eleven pieces of information 
            recorded for each case. A table with 3,142 rows and 11 columns could hold these data, 
            where each row represents a county and each column represents a particular piece of 
            information.

      <title>Types of variables</title>

      <p>
        Examine the <c>unemp_rate</c>, <c>pop</c>, <c>state</c>, and <c>median_edu</c> 
        variables in the <c>county</c> data set. Each of these variables is inherently different 
        from the other three, yet some share certain characteristics.
      </p>

      <p>
        First consider <c>unemp_rate</c>, which is said to be a <term>numerical</term> variable 
        since it can take a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add, subtract, 
        or take averages with those values. On the other hand, we would not classify a variable 
        reporting telephone area codes as numerical since the average, sum, and difference of 
        area codes doesn't have any clear meaning.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <c>pop</c> variable is also numerical, although it seems to be a little different 
        than <c>unemp_rate</c>. This variable of the population count can only take whole 
        non-negative numbers (0, 1, 2, <ellipsis/>). For this reason, the population variable is 
        said to be <term>discrete</term> since it can only take numerical values with jumps. 
        On the other hand, the unemployment rate variable is said to be <term>continuous</term>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The variable <c>state</c> can take up to 51 values after accounting for Washington, DC: 
        AL, AK, <ellipsis/>, and WY. Because the responses themselves are categories, 
        <c>state</c> is called a <term>categorical</term> variable, and the possible values are 
        called the variable's <term>levels</term>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, consider the <c>median_edu</c> variable, which describes the median education 
        level of county residents and takes values <c>below_hs</c>, <c>hs_diploma</c>, 
        <c>some_college</c>, or <c>bachelors</c> in each county. This variable seems to be a 
        hybrid: it is a categorical variable but the levels have a natural ordering. A variable 
        with these properties is called an <term>ordinal</term> variable, while a regular 
        categorical variable without this type of special ordering is called a 
        <term>nominal</term> variable. To simplify analyses, any ordinal variable in this book 
        will be treated as a nominal (unordered) categorical variable.

            Data were collected about students in a statistics course. Three variables were

            The number of siblings and student height represent numerical variables. Because the 
            number of siblings is a count, it is discrete. Height varies continuously, so it is a 
            continuous numerical variable. The last variable classifies students into two 
            categories<mdash />those who have and those who have not taken a statistics 
            course<mdash />which makes this variable categorical.

      <title>Relationships between variables</title>

      <p>
        Many analyses are motivated by a researcher looking for a relationship between two or 
        more variables. A social scientist may like to answer some of the following questions:
      </p>

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If homeownership is lower than the national average in one county, will the percent 
              of multi-unit structures in that county tend to be above or below the national 
              average?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Does a higher than average increase in county population tend to correspond to 
              counties with higher or lower median household incomes?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              How useful a predictor is median education level for the median household income for 
              US counties?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        To answer these questions, data must be collected, such as the <c>county</c> data set. 
        Examining summary statistics could provide insights for each of the three questions about 
        counties. Additionally, graphs can be used to visually explore data.
      </p>

      <p>
        <term>Scatterplots</term> are one type of graph used to study the relationship between 
        two numerical variables. <xref ref="fig-multiunit-homeownership"/> compares the variables 
        <c>homeownership</c> and <c>multi_unit</c>, which is the percent of units in multi-unit 
        structures (e.g. apartments, condos). Each point on the plot represents a single county. 
        For instance, the highlighted dot corresponds to County 413 in the <c>county</c> data set: 
        Chattahoochee County, Georgia, which has 39.4% of units in multi-unit structures and a 
        homeownership rate of 31.3%. The scatterplot suggests a relationship between the two 
        variables: counties with a higher rate of multi-units tend to have lower homeownership 
        rates. We might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and investigate each idea 
        to determine which are the most reasonable explanations.

            county shown on the horizontal axis and homeownership rate shown on the vertical axis. 
            The data range from 0% to almost 100% for both variables. In general, the points are 
            much more concentrated in the upper left corner of the graph and then trend downward 
            for observations further to the right while also becoming more sparse. One point is 
            annotated at the location (39.4%, 31.3%).

      <p>
        The multi-unit and homeownership rates are said to be associated because the plot shows a 
        discernible pattern. When two variables show some connection with one another, they are 
        called <term>associated</term> variables. Associated variables can also be called 
        <term>dependent</term> variables and vice-versa.

      <title>Explanatory and response variables</title>

      <p>
        When we ask questions about the relationship between two variables, we sometimes also want 
        to determine if the change in one variable causes a change in the other. Consider the 
        following rephrasing of an earlier question about the <c>county</c> data set:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>If there is an increase in the median household income in a county, does this drive 
          an increase in its population?</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In this question, we are asking whether one variable affects another. If this is our 
        underlying belief, then <em>median household income</em> is the <term>explanatory 
        variable</term> and the <em>population change</em> is the <term>response variable</term> 
        in the hypothesized relationship.<fn>Sometimes the explanatory variable is called the 
        <term>independent variable</term> and the response variable is called the 
        <term>dependent variable</term>. However, this becomes confusing since a <em>pair</em> 
        of variables might be independent or dependent, so we avoid this language.</fn>
      </p>

      <insight>
        <title>Explanatory and response variables</title>
        <p>
          When we suspect one variable might causally affect another, we label the first variable 
          the <em>explanatory variable</em> and the second the <em>response variable</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many pairs of variables, there is no hypothesized relationship, and these labels 
          would not be applied to either variable in such cases.
        </p>
      </insight>

      <p>
        Bear in mind that the act of labeling the variables in this way does nothing to ensure 
        that a causal relationship exists. A formal evaluation to check whether one variable 
        causes a change in another requires an experiment.

    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-observational-studies-experiments">
      <title>Introducing observational studies and experiments</title>

      <p>
        There are two primary types of data collection: observational studies and experiments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Researchers perform an <term>observational study</term> when they collect data in a way 
        that does not directly interfere with how the data arise. For instance, researchers may 
        collect information via surveys, review medical records, or follow a cohort of many similar 
        individuals to study why certain diseases might develop. In each of these situations, 
        researchers merely observe the data that arise. In general, observational studies can 
        provide evidence of a naturally occurring association between variables, but they cannot 
        by themselves show a causal connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        When researchers want to investigate the possibility of a causal connection, they conduct 
        an <term>experiment</term>. Usually there will be both an explanatory and a response 
        variable. For instance, we may suspect administering a drug will reduce mortality in 
        heart attack patients over the following year. To check if there really is a causal 
        connection between the explanatory variable and the response, researchers will collect 
        a sample of individuals and split them into groups. The individuals in each group are 
        <em>assigned</em> a treatment. When individuals are randomly assigned to a group, the 
        experiment is called a <term>randomized experiment</term>. For example, each heart attack 
        patient in the drug trial could be randomly assigned, perhaps by flipping a coin, into one 
        of two groups: the first group receives a <term>placebo</term> (fake treatment) and the 
        second group receives the drug. See the case study in <xref ref="sec-stents-strokes"/> 
        for another example of an experiment, though that study did not employ a placebo.
      </p>

      <insight>
        <title>Association does not imply causation</title>
        <p>
          In general, association does not imply causation, and causation can only be inferred 
          from a randomized experiment.

In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These patients were randomly split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.

    <title>Sampling principles and strategies</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The first step in conducting research is to identify topics or questions that are to be investigated. A clearly laid out research question is helpful in identifying what subjects or cases should be studied and what variables are important. It is also important to consider <em>how</em> data are collected so that they are reliable and help achieve the research goals.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-populations-samples">
      <title>Populations and samples</title>

      <p>
        Consider the following three research questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Over the last 5 years, what is the average time to complete a degree for Duke undergrads?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Does a new drug reduce the number of deaths in patients with severe heart disease?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        Each research question refers to a target <term>population</term>. In the first question, the target population is all swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean, and each fish represents a case. Often times, it is too expensive to collect data for every case in a population. Instead, a sample is taken. A <term>sample</term> represents a subset of the cases and is often a small fraction of the population. For instance, 60 swordfish (or some other number) in the population might be selected, and this sample data may be used to provide an estimate of the population average and answer the research question.
      </p>

      <exercise xml:id="gp-population-identification" divisional="hint">
        <title>Identifying populations</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            For the second and third questions above, identify the target population and what represents an individual case.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            (2) This question is only relevant to students who complete their degree; the average cannot be computed using a student who never finished her degree. Thus, only Duke undergrads who graduated in the last five years represent cases in the population under consideration. Each such student is an individual case. (3) A person with severe heart disease represents a case. The population includes all people with severe heart disease.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </exercise>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-anecdotal-evidence">
      <title>Anecdotal evidence</title>

      <p>
        Consider the following possible responses to the three research questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            A man on the news got mercury poisoning from eating swordfish, so the average mercury concentration in swordfish must be dangerously high.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I met two students who took more than 7 years to graduate from Duke, so it must take longer to graduate at Duke than at many other colleges.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            My friend's dad had a heart attack and died after they gave him a new heart disease drug, so the drug must not work.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        Each conclusion is based on data. However, there are two problems. First, the data only represent one or two cases. Second, and more importantly, it is unclear whether these cases are actually representative of the population. Data collected in this haphazard fashion are called <term>anecdotal evidence</term>.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-mn-winter">
        <caption>
          In February 2010, some media pundits cited one large snow storm as valid evidence against global warming. As comedian Jon Stewart pointed out, <q>It's one storm, in one region, of one country.</q>

      <assemblage>
        <title>Anecdotal evidence</title>
        <p>
          Be careful of data collected in a haphazard fashion. Such evidence may be true and verifiable, but it may only represent extraordinary cases.
        </p>
      </assemblage>

      <p>
        Anecdotal evidence typically is composed of unusual cases that we recall based on their striking characteristics. For instance, we are more likely to remember the two people we met who took 7 years to graduate than the six others who graduated in four years. Instead of looking at the most unusual cases, we should examine a sample of many cases that represent the population.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-sampling-population">
      <title>Sampling from a population</title>

      <p>
        We might try to estimate the time to graduation for Duke undergraduates in the last 5 years by collecting a sample of students. All graduates in the last 5 years represent the <em>population</em>, and graduates who are selected for review are collectively called the <em>sample</em>. In general, we always seek to <em>randomly</em> select a sample from a population. The most basic type of random selection is equivalent to how raffles are conducted. For example, in selecting graduates, we could write each graduate's name on a raffle ticket and draw 100 tickets. The selected names would represent a random sample of 100 graduates. We pick samples randomly to reduce the chance we introduce biases.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-pop-to-sample">

          In this graphic, five graduates are randomly selected from the population to be included in the sample.

      <example xml:id="ex-bias-example">
        <title>Unintentional bias</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose we ask a student who happens to be majoring in nutrition to select several graduates for the study. What kind of students do you think she might collect? Do you think her sample would be representative of all graduates?
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps she would pick a disproportionate number of graduates from health-related fields. Or perhaps her selection would be a good representation of the population. When selecting samples by hand, we run the risk of picking a <term>biased</term> sample, even if their bias isn't intended.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>

      <figure xml:id="fig-pop-to-sub-sample">
        <caption>
          Asked to pick a sample of graduates, a nutrition major might inadvertently pick a disproportionate number of graduates from health-related majors.

        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        If someone was permitted to pick and choose exactly which graduates were included in the sample, it is entirely possible that the sample could be skewed to that person's interests, which may be entirely unintentional. This introduces <term>bias</term> into a sample. Sampling randomly helps resolve this problem. The most basic random sample is called a <term>simple random sample</term>, which is equivalent to using a raffle to select cases. This means that each case in the population has an equal chance of being included and there is no implied connection between the cases in the sample.
      </p>

      <p>
        The act of taking a simple random sample helps minimize bias. However, bias can crop up in other ways. Even when people are picked at random, e.g. for surveys, caution must be exercised if the <term>non-response rate</term> is high. For instance, if only 30% of the people randomly sampled for a survey actually respond, then it is unclear whether the results are <term>representative</term> of the entire population. This <term>non-response bias</term> can skew results.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-survey-sample">
        <caption>
          Due to the possibility of non-response, survey studies may only reach a certain group within the population. It is difficult, and often times impossible, to completely fix this problem.
        </caption>

          <description>Graphic showing a population of interest with a smaller circle representing the population actually sampled, from which a sample is drawn.</description>
        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Another common downfall is a <term>convenience sample</term>, where individuals who are easily accessible are more likely to be included in the sample. For instance, if a political survey is done by stopping people walking in the Bronx, this will not represent all of New York City. It is often difficult to discern what sub-population a convenience sample represents.

        <statement>
          <p>
            We can easily access ratings for products, sellers, and companies through websites. These ratings are based only on those people who go out of their way to provide a rating.

          <p>
            Answers will vary. From our own anecdotal experiences, we believe people tend to rant more about products that fell below expectations than rave about those that perform as expected. For this reason, we suspect there is a negative bias in product ratings on sites like Amazon. However, since our experiences may not be representative, we also keep an open mind.

      <title>Observational studies</title>

      <p>
        Data where no treatment has been explicitly applied (or explicitly withheld) is called <term>observational data</term>. For instance, the loan data and county data described in <xref ref="sec-data-basics"/> are both examples of observational data. Making causal conclusions based on experiments is often reasonable. However, making the same causal conclusions based on observational data can be treacherous and is not recommended. Thus, observational studies are generally only sufficient to show associations or form hypotheses that we later check using experiments.

      <exercise xml:id="gp-sunscreen-confounding" divisional="hint">
        <title>Sunscreen and skin cancer</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose an observational study tracked sunscreen use and skin cancer, and it was found that the more sunscreen someone used, the more likely the person was to have skin cancer. Does this mean sunscreen <em>causes</em> skin cancer?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            No. See the paragraph following the exercise for an explanation.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </exercise>

      <p>
        Some previous research tells us that using sunscreen actually reduces skin cancer risk, so maybe there is another variable that can explain this hypothetical association between sunscreen usage and skin cancer. One important piece of information that is absent is sun exposure. If someone is out in the sun all day, she is more likely to use sunscreen <em>and</em> more likely to get skin cancer. Exposure to the sun is unaccounted for in the simple investigation.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-sun-causes-cancer">

          Sun exposure is a confounding variable that is associated with both sunscreen use and skin cancer.

            Figure <xref ref="fig-multiunit-homeownership"/> shows a negative association between the homeownership rate and the percentage of multi-unit structures in a county. However, it is unreasonable to conclude that there is a causal relationship between the two variables. Suggest a variable that might explain the negative relationship.

        <solution>
          <p>
            Answers will vary. Population density may be important. If a county is very dense, then this may require a larger fraction of residents to live in multi-unit structures. Additionally, the high density may contribute to increases in property value, making homeownership infeasible for many residents.

        Observational studies come in two forms: prospective and retrospective studies. A <term>prospective study</term> identifies individuals and collects information as events unfold. For instance, medical researchers may identify and follow a group of patients over many years to assess the possible influences of behavior on cancer risk. One example of such a study is The Nurses' Health Study, started in 1976 and expanded in 1989. This prospective study recruits registered nurses and then collects data from them using questionnaires. <term>Retrospective studies</term> collect data after events have taken place, e.g. researchers may review past events in medical records. Some data sets may contain both prospectively- and retrospectively-collected variables.

      <title>Four sampling methods</title>

      <p>
        Almost all statistical methods are based on the notion of implied randomness. If observational data are not collected in a random framework from a population, these statistical methods<mdash/>the estimates and errors associated with the estimates<mdash/>are not reliable. Here we consider four random sampling techniques: simple, stratified, cluster, and multistage sampling. <xref ref="fig-simple-stratified"/> and <xref ref="fig-cluster-multistage"/> provide graphical representations of these techniques.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-simple-stratified">
        <caption>
          Examples of simple random and stratified sampling. In the top panel, simple random sampling was used to randomly select the 18 cases. In the bottom panel, stratified sampling was used: cases were grouped into strata, then simple random sampling was employed within each stratum.
        </caption>

          <description>Two figures showing simple random sampling (top) with 18 randomly selected points, and stratified sampling (bottom) with 6 strata and 3 points selected from each stratum.</description>
        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        <term>Simple random sampling</term> is probably the most intuitive form of random sampling. Consider the salaries of Major League Baseball (MLB) players, where each player is a member of one of the league's 30 teams. To take a simple random sample of 120 baseball players and their salaries, we could write the names of that season's several hundreds of players onto slips of paper, drop the slips into a bucket, shake the bucket around until we are sure the names are all mixed up, then draw out slips until we have the sample of 120 players. In general, a sample is referred to as <q>simple random</q> if each case in the population has an equal chance of being included in the final sample <em>and</em> knowing that a case is included in a sample does not provide useful information about which other cases are included.
      </p>

      <p>
        <term>Stratified sampling</term> is a divide-and-conquer sampling strategy. The population is divided into groups called <term>strata</term>. The strata are chosen so that similar cases are grouped together, then a second sampling method, usually simple random sampling, is employed within each stratum. In the baseball salary example, the teams could represent the strata, since some teams have a lot more money (up to 4 times as much!). Then we might randomly sample 4 players from each team for a total of 120 players.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stratified sampling is especially useful when the cases in each stratum are very similar with respect to the outcome of interest. The downside is that analyzing data from a stratified sample is a more complex task than analyzing data from a simple random sample. The analysis methods introduced in this book would need to be extended to analyze data collected using stratified sampling.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="ex-stratified-advantage">
        <title>Benefits of stratified sampling</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Why would it be good for cases within each stratum to be very similar?
          </p>
          <p>
            We might get a more stable estimate for the subpopulation in a stratum if the cases are very similar, leading to more precise estimates within each group. When we combine these estimates into a single estimate for the full population, that population estimate will tend to be more precise since each individual group estimate is itself more precise.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>

      <p>
        In a <term>cluster sample</term>, we break up the population into many groups, called <term>clusters</term>. Then we sample a fixed number of clusters and include all observations from each of those clusters in the sample. A <term>multistage sample</term> is like a cluster sample, but rather than keeping all observations in each cluster, we collect a random sample within each selected cluster.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-cluster-multistage">
        <caption>
          Examples of cluster and multistage sampling. In the top panel, cluster sampling was used: data were binned into nine clusters, three of these clusters were sampled, and all observations within these three clusters were included in the sample. In the bottom panel, multistage sampling was used, which differs from cluster sampling only in that we randomly select a subset of each cluster to be included in the sample rather than measuring every case in each sampled cluster.
        </caption>
        <image source="ch_intro_to_data/figures/samplingMethodsFigure/cluster_multistage.pdf" width="80%">
          <description>Two figures showing cluster sampling (top) with all observations from selected clusters, and multistage sampling (bottom) with random samples from within selected clusters.</description>
        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Sometimes cluster or multistage sampling can be more economical than the alternative sampling techniques. Also, unlike stratified sampling, these approaches are most helpful when there is a lot of case-to-case variability within a cluster but the clusters themselves don't look very different from one another. For example, if neighborhoods represented clusters, then cluster or multistage sampling work best when the neighborhoods are very diverse. A downside of these methods is that more advanced techniques are typically required to analyze the data, though the methods in this book can be extended to handle such data.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="ex-malaria-sampling">
        <title>Choosing a sampling design</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Suppose we are interested in estimating the malaria rate in a densely tropical portion of rural Indonesia. We learn that there are 30 villages in that part of the Indonesian jungle, each more or less similar to the next. Our goal is to test 150 individuals for malaria. What sampling method should be employed?
          </p>
          <p>
            A simple random sample would likely draw individuals from all 30 villages, which could make data collection extremely expensive. Stratified sampling would be a challenge since it is unclear how we would build strata of similar individuals. However, cluster sampling or multistage sampling seem like very good ideas. If we decided to use multistage sampling, we might randomly select half of the villages, then randomly select 10 people from each. This would probably reduce our data collection costs substantially in comparison to a simple random sample, and the cluster sample would still give us reliable information, even if we would need to analyze the data with slightly more advanced methods than we discuss in this book.

          <p>
            A study published in the
<em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>
asked a group of 200 randomly sampled men and
women to evaluate how they felt about various subjects,
such as camping, health care, architecture, taxidermy, 
crossword puzzles, and Japan in order to measure their
attitude towards mostly independent stimuli.
Then, they presented the participants with information
about a new product: a microwave oven. This microwave oven
does not exist, but the participants didn't know this,
and were given three positive and three negative fake reviews.
People who reacted positively to the subjects on the
dispositional attitude measurement also tended to react 
positively to the microwave oven, and those who reacted
negatively tended to react negatively to it.
Researchers concluded that "some people tend to 
like things, whereas others tend to dislike things, and a more thorough 
understanding of this tendency will lead to a more thorough understanding of 
the psychology of attitudes." <fn>Citation: Hepler:2013</fn>

"Researchers analyzed data from 23,123 health plan members who

when they were 50-60 years old. 23 years later, about 25% of the group had

dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that

    <title>Experiments</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Studies where the researchers assign treatments to cases are called <term>experiments</term>. When this assignment includes randomization, e.g. using a coin flip to decide which treatment a patient receives, it is called a <term>randomized experiment</term>. Randomized experiments are fundamentally important when trying to show a causal connection between two variables.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-experimental-design">
      <title>Principles of experimental design</title>

      <p>
        Randomized experiments are generally built on four principles.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Controlling.</title>
          <p>
            Researchers assign treatments to cases, and they do their best to <term>control</term> any other differences in the groups.<fn>This is a different concept than a <em>control group</em>, which we discuss in the second principle and in <xref ref="subsec-reducing-bias" />.</fn> For example, when patients take a drug in pill form, some patients take the pill with only a sip of water while others may have it with an entire glass of water. To control for the effect of water consumption, a doctor may ask all patients to drink a 12 ounce glass of water with the pill.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Randomization.</title>
          <p>
            Researchers randomize patients into treatment groups to account for variables that cannot be controlled. For example, some patients may be more susceptible to a disease than others due to their dietary habits. Randomizing patients into the treatment or control group helps even out such differences, and it also prevents accidental bias from entering the study.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Replication.</title>
          <p>
            The more cases researchers observe, the more accurately they can estimate the effect of the explanatory variable on the response. In a single study, we <term>replicate</term> by collecting a sufficiently large sample. Additionally, a group of scientists may replicate an entire study to verify an earlier finding.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Blocking.</title>
          <p>
            Researchers sometimes know or suspect that variables, other than the treatment, influence the response. Under these circumstances, they may first group individuals based on this variable into <term>blocks</term> and then randomize cases within each block to the treatment groups. This strategy is often referred to as <term>blocking</term>. For instance, if we are looking at the effect of a drug on heart attacks, we might first split patients in the study into low-risk and high-risk blocks, then randomly assign half the patients from each block to the control group and the other half to the treatment group, as shown in <xref ref="fig-blocking" />. This strategy ensures each treatment group has an equal number of low-risk and high-risk patients.
          </p>
        </li>
      </dl>

      <figure xml:id="fig-blocking">
        <caption>Blocking using a variable depicting patient risk. Patients are first divided into low-risk and high-risk blocks, then each block is evenly separated into the treatment groups using randomization. This strategy ensures an equal representation of patients in each treatment group from both the low-risk and high-risk categories.</caption>
        <image source="ch_intro_to_data/figures/figureShowingBlocking/figureShowingBlocking.pdf" width="82%">
          <description>There are three main stages shown in this figure, from top to bottom. The upper stage shows the numbering of patients as a rectangle containing 54 dots in a grid that are labeled with numbers 1 through 54. The dots are one of two colors: blue (high risk) and red (low risk). The second stage shows the two colored dots broken into two blocks. On the left are the low-risk patients (red) and on the right are the high-risk patients (blue). Going into the bottom third stage, are two boxes labeled "control" and "treatment", where half of the low-risk (red) and half of the blue (high risk) points have been randomly placed into each of these two experiment groups.</description>
        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        It is important to incorporate the first three experimental design principles into any study, and this book describes applicable methods for analyzing data from such experiments. Blocking is a slightly more advanced technique, and statistical methods in this book may be extended to analyze data collected using blocking.
      </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-reducing-bias">
      <title>Reducing bias in human experiments</title>

      <p>
        Randomized experiments are the gold standard for data collection, but they do not ensure an unbiased perspective into the cause and effect relationship in all cases. Human studies are perfect examples where bias can unintentionally arise. Here we reconsider a study where a new drug was used to treat heart attack patients. In particular, researchers wanted to know if the drug reduced deaths in patients.
      </p>

      <p>
        These researchers designed a randomized experiment because they wanted to draw causal conclusions about the drug's effect. Study volunteers<fn>Human subjects are often called <term>patients</term>, <term>volunteers</term>, or <term>study participants</term>.</fn> were randomly placed into two study groups. One group, the <term>treatment group</term>, received the drug. The other group, called the <term>control group</term>, did not receive any drug treatment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Put yourself in the place of a person in the study. If you are in the treatment group, you are given a fancy new drug that you anticipate will help you. On the other hand, a person in the other group doesn't receive the drug and sits idly, hoping her participation doesn't increase her risk of death. These perspectives suggest there are actually two effects: the one of interest is the effectiveness of the drug, and the second is an emotional effect that is difficult to quantify.
      </p>

      <p>
        Researchers aren't usually interested in the emotional effect, which might bias the study. To circumvent this problem, researchers do not want patients to know which group they are in. When researchers keep the patients uninformed about their treatment, the study is said to be <term>blind</term>. But there is one problem: if a patient doesn't receive a treatment, she will know she is in the control group. The solution to this problem is to give fake treatments to patients in the control group. A fake treatment is called a <term>placebo</term>, and an effective placebo is the key to making a study truly blind. A classic example of a placebo is a sugar pill that is made to look like the actual treatment pill. Often times, a placebo results in a slight but real improvement in patients. This effect has been dubbed the <term>placebo effect</term>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The patients are not the only ones who should be blinded: doctors and researchers can accidentally bias a study. When a doctor knows a patient has been given the real treatment, she might inadvertently give that patient more attention or care than a patient that she knows is on the placebo. To guard against this bias, which again has been found to have a measurable effect in some instances, most modern studies employ a <term>double-blind</term> setup where doctors or researchers who interact with patients are, just like the patients, unaware of who is or is not receiving the treatment.<fn>There are always some researchers involved in the study who do know which patients are receiving which treatment. However, they do not interact with the study's patients and do not tell the blinded health care professionals who is receiving which treatment.</fn>
      </p>

      <exercise xml:id="gp-stents-blinding" divisional="hint">
        <title>Blinding in the stent study</title>
        <statement>
          <p>Look back to the study in <xref ref="sec-stents-strokes"/> where researchers were testing whether stents were effective at reducing strokes in at-risk patients. Is this an experiment? Was the study blinded? Was it double-blinded?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>The researchers assigned the patients into their treatment groups, so this study was an experiment. However, the patients could distinguish what treatment they received, so this study was not blind. The study could not be double-blind since it was not blind.</p>
        </solution>
      </exercise>

      <exercise xml:id="gp-sham-surgery" divisional="hint">
        <title>Placebos via sham surgery</title>
        <statement>
          <p>For the study in <xref ref="sec-stents-strokes"/>, could the researchers have employed a placebo? If so, what would that placebo have looked like?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>Ultimately, can we make patients think they got treated from a surgery? In fact, we can, and some experiments use what's called a <term>sham surgery</term>. In a sham surgery, the patient does undergo surgery, but the patient does not receive the full treatment, though they will still get a placebo effect.</p>
        </solution>
      </exercise>

      <p>
        You may have many questions about the ethics of sham surgeries to create a placebo after reading the previous exercise. These questions may have even arisen in your mind in the general experiment context, where a possibly helpful treatment was withheld from individuals in the control group; the main difference is that a sham surgery tends to create additional risk, while withholding a treatment only maintains a person's risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are always multiple viewpoints of experiments and placebos, and rarely is it obvious which is ethically <q>correct</q>. For instance, is it ethical to use a sham surgery when it creates a risk to the patient? However, if we don't use sham surgeries, we may promote the use of a costly treatment that has no real effect; if this happens, money and other resources will be diverted away from other treatments that are known to be helpful. Ultimately, this is a difficult situation where we cannot perfectly protect both the patients who have volunteered for the study and the patients who may benefit (or not) from the treatment in the future.

            To assess the effectiveness of taking large doses
of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, 
researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff

A quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo,
and the rest were evenly divided between 1g Vitamin C,
3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be
taken at onset of a cold for the following two days.
All tablets had identical appearance and packaging.
The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the
patients knew which patient received which treatment,
but the researchers assessing the patients when they
were sick did not. 
No significant differences were observed in any measure
of cold duration or severity between the four groups,

            A researcher is interested 
in the effects of exercise on mental health and he proposes the following study: Use 
stratified random sampling to ensure representative proportions of 18-30, 31-40 and 41-
55 year olds from the population. Next, randomly assign half the subjects from each age 
group to exercise twice a week, and instruct the rest not to exercise. Conduct a mental 
health exam at the beginning and at the end of the study, and compare the results.

            The city of Seattle, WA has an open data portal that

we have information on the pet's name and species.
The following visualization plots the proportion of dogs
with a given name versus the proportion of cats with the
same name.
The 20 most common cat and dog names are displayed.
The diagonal line on the plot is the <m>x = y</m> line;
if a name appeared on this line, the name's popularity
would be exactly the same for dogs and cats.

          <p>
            Chia Pets -- those terra-cotta 
figurines that sprout fuzzy green hair -- made the chia plant a household name. But chia 
has gained an entirely new reputation as a diet supplement. In one 2009 study, a team 
of researchers recruited 38 men and divided them randomly into two groups: treatment or 
control. They also recruited 38 women, and they randomly placed half of these 
participants into the treatment group and the other half into the control group. One 
group was given 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, and the other was given a placebo. 
The subjects volunteered to be a part of the study. After 12 weeks, the scientists found 
no significant difference between the groups in appetite or weight loss.

well-being in young adults, participants were randomly assigned to three 
groups: (1) diet-as-usual, (2) an ecological momentary intervention involving 
text message reminders to increase their fruits and vegetable consumption plus 
a voucher to purchase them, or (3) a fruit and vegetable intervention in 
which participants were given two additional daily servings of fresh fruits and 
vegetables to consume on top of their normal diet. Participants were asked to 
take a nightly survey on their smartphones.
Participants were student volunteers at the University of

            In a study of three nationally representative large-scale data sets from Ireland, 
the United States, and the United Kingdom (n = 17,247), teenagers between the 
ages of 12 to 15 were asked to keep a diary of their screen time and answer questions about how they felt or acted.
The answers to these questions 
were then used to compute a psychological well-being score.
Additional data were collected and included in the analysis,
such as each child's sex and age, and on the mother’s education,
ethnicity, psychological distress, and employment.
The study concluded that there is little clear-cut evidence
that screen time decreases adolescent
well-being.<fn>Citation: orben2018screens</fn>
