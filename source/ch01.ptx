  <title>Introduction to data</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Scientists seek to answer questions using rigorous methods and careful observations.
      These observations<mdash />collected from the likes of field notes, surveys, and 
      experiments<mdash />form the backbone of a statistical investigation and are called 
      <term>data</term>. Statistics is the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw 
      conclusions from data, and in this first chapter, we focus on both the properties of 
      data and on the collection of data.

    <title>Case study: using stents to prevent strokes</title>
    <idx>stroke</idx>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        This section introduces a classic challenge in statistics: evaluating the efficacy of 
        a medical treatment. Terms in this section, and indeed much of this chapter, will all 
        be revisited later in the text. The plan for now is simply to get a sense of the role 
        statistics can play in practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this section we will consider an experiment that studies effectiveness of stents in 
        treating patients at risk of stroke. Stents are devices put inside blood vessels that 
        assist in patient recovery after cardiac events and reduce the risk of an additional 
        heart attack or death. Many doctors have hoped that there would be similar benefits for 
        patients at risk of stroke. We start by writing the principal question the researchers 
        hope to answer:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Does the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke?
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The researchers who asked this question conducted an experiment with 451 at-risk patients. 
        Each volunteer patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups:
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Treatment group</term>. Patients in the treatment group received a stent and 
              medical management. The medical management included medications, management of risk 
              factors, and help in lifestyle modification.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Control group</term>. Patients in the control group received the same medical 
              management as the treatment group, but they did not receive stents.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Researchers randomly assigned 224 patients to the treatment group and 227 to the control 
        group. In this study, the control group provides a reference point against which we can 
        measure the medical impact of stents in the treatment group.
      </p>

      <p>
        Researchers studied the effect of stents at two time points: 30 days after enrollment and 
        365 days after enrollment. The results of 5 patients are summarized in 
        <xref ref="table-stent-study-results-df"/>. Patient outcomes are recorded as 
        <q>stroke</q> or <q>no event</q>, representing whether or not the patient had a stroke 
        at the end of a time period.

      Considering data from each patient individually would be a long, cumbersome path towards 
      answering the original research question. Instead, performing a statistical data analysis 
      allows us to consider all of the data at once. <xref ref="table-stent-study-results"/> 
      summarizes the raw data in a more helpful way. In this table, we can quickly see what 
      happened over the entire study. For instance, to identify the number of patients in the 
      treatment group who had a stroke within 30 days, we look on the left-side of the table at 
      the intersection of the treatment and stroke: 33.

      <title>Computing proportions from the stent study</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Of the 224 patients in the treatment group, 45 had a stroke by the end of the first 
          year. Using these two numbers, compute the proportion of patients in the treatment 
          group who had a stroke by the end of their first year.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The proportion of the 224 patients who had a stroke within 365 days: 
          <m>45/224 = 0.20</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      We can compute summary statistics from the table. A <term>summary statistic</term> is a 
      single number summarizing a large amount of data. For instance, the primary results of 
      the study after 1 year could be described by two summary statistics: the proportion of 
      people who had a stroke in the treatment and control groups.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Proportion who had a stroke in the treatment (stent) group: 
            <m>45/224 = 0.20 = 20\%</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Proportion who had a stroke in the control group: <m>28/227 = 0.12 = 12\%</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      These two summary statistics are useful in looking for differences in the groups, and we 
      are in for a surprise: an additional 8% of patients in the treatment group had a stroke! 
      This is important for two reasons. First, it is contrary to what doctors expected, which 
      was that stents would <em>reduce</em> the rate of strokes. Second, it leads to a 
      statistical question: do the data show a <q>real</q> difference between the groups?
    </p>

    <p>
      This second question is subtle. Suppose you flip a coin 100 times. While the chance a coin 
      lands heads in any given coin flip is 50%, we probably won't observe exactly 50 heads. This 
      type of fluctuation is part of almost any type of data generating process. It is possible 
      that the 8% difference in the stent study is due to this natural variation. However, the 
      larger the difference we observe (for a particular sample size), the less believable it is 
      that the difference is due to chance. So what we are really asking is the following: is 
      the difference so large that we should reject the notion that it was due to chance?
    </p>

    <p>
      While we don't yet have our statistical tools to fully address this question on our own, 
      we can comprehend the conclusions of the published analysis: there was compelling evidence 
      of harm by stents in this study of stroke patients.
    </p>

    <warning>
      <title>Be careful</title>
      <p>
        Do not generalize the results of this study to all patients and all stents. This study 
        looked at patients with very specific characteristics who volunteered to be a part of 
        this study and who may not be representative of all stroke patients. In addition, there 
        are many types of stents and this study only considered the self-expanding Wingspan stent 
        (Boston Scientific). However, this study does leave us with an important lesson: we 
        should keep our eyes open for surprises.

        <statement>
          <p>
            A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish 
            to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, 
            researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with 
            migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 
            43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed 
            to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture 
            (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received 
            acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the 
            contingency table below.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Effective organization and description of data is a first step in most analyses. This 
        section introduces the <em>data matrix</em> for organizing data as well as some 
        terminology about different forms of data that will be used throughout this book.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-observations-variables">

      <idx>loan50 data</idx>

      <p>
        <xref ref="table-loan50-df"/> displays rows 1, 2, 3, and 50 of a data set for 50 
        randomly sampled loans offered through Lending Club, which is a peer-to-peer lending 
        company. These observations will be referred to as the <c>loan50</c> data set.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each row in the table represents a single loan. The formal name for a row is a 
        <term>case</term> or <term>observational unit</term>. The columns represent 
        characteristics, called <term>variables</term>, for each of the loans. For example, 
        the first row represents a loan of $22,000 with an interest rate of 10.90%, 
        where the borrower is based in New Jersey (NJ) and has an income of $59,000.

        <title>Reading data from a data matrix</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            What is the grade of the first loan in <xref ref="table-loan50-df"/>? And what is 
            the home ownership status of the borrower for that first loan?

      <p>
        In practice, it is especially important to ask clarifying questions to ensure important 
        aspects of the data are understood. For instance, it is always important to be sure we 
        know what each variable means and the units of measurement. Descriptions of the 
        <c>loan50</c> variables are given in <xref ref="table-loan50-variables"/>.

      <p>
        The data in <xref ref="table-loan50-df"/> represent a <term>data matrix</term>, which 
        is a convenient and common way to organize data, especially if collecting data in a 
        spreadsheet. Each row of a data matrix corresponds to a unique case (observational unit), 
        and each column corresponds to a variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        When recording data, use a data matrix unless you have a very good reason to use a 
        different structure. This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables 
        as new columns.
      </p>

      <exercise xml:id="guided-practice-gradebook">
        <title>Organizing a gradebook</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The grades for assignments, quizzes, and exams in a course are often recorded in a 
            gradebook that takes the form of a data matrix. How might you organize grade data 
            using a data matrix?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            There are multiple strategies that can be followed. One common strategy is to have 
            each student represented by a row, and then add a column for each assignment, quiz, 
            or exam. Under this setup, it is easy to review a single line to understand a 
            student's grade history. There should also be columns to include student information, 
            such as one column to list student names.

        <title>Organizing county data</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <idx>county data</idx>
            We consider data for 3,142 counties in the United States. The data includes each county's 
            name, the state where it resides, its population in 2017, how its population changed from 
            2010 to 2017, poverty rate, and six additional characteristics.
            How might the county data described above be organized in a data matrix?

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Each county may be viewed as a case, and there are eleven pieces of information 
            recorded for each case. A table with 3,142 rows and 11 columns could hold these data, 
            where each row represents a county and each column represents a particular piece of 
            information.

      <title>Types of variables</title>

      <p>
        Examine the <c>unemp_rate</c>, <c>pop</c>, <c>state</c>, and <c>median_edu</c> 
        variables in the <c>county</c> data set. Each of these variables is inherently different 
        from the other three, yet some share certain characteristics.
      </p>

      <p>
        First consider <c>unemp_rate</c>, which is said to be a <term>numerical</term> variable 
        since it can take a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add, subtract, 
        or take averages with those values. On the other hand, we would not classify a variable 
        reporting telephone area codes as numerical since the average, sum, and difference of 
        area codes doesn't have any clear meaning.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <c>pop</c> variable is also numerical, although it seems to be a little different 
        than <c>unemp_rate</c>. This variable of the population count can only take whole 
        non-negative numbers (0, 1, 2, <ellipsis/>). For this reason, the population variable is 
        said to be <term>discrete</term> since it can only take numerical values with jumps. 
        On the other hand, the unemployment rate variable is said to be <term>continuous</term>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The variable <c>state</c> can take up to 51 values after accounting for Washington, DC: 
        AL, AK, <ellipsis/>, and WY. Because the responses themselves are categories, 
        <c>state</c> is called a <term>categorical</term> variable, and the possible values are 
        called the variable's <term>levels</term>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, consider the <c>median_edu</c> variable, which describes the median education 
        level of county residents and takes values <c>below_hs</c>, <c>hs_diploma</c>, 
        <c>some_college</c>, or <c>bachelors</c> in each county. This variable seems to be a 
        hybrid: it is a categorical variable but the levels have a natural ordering. A variable 
        with these properties is called an <term>ordinal</term> variable, while a regular 
        categorical variable without this type of special ordering is called a 
        <term>nominal</term> variable. To simplify analyses, any ordinal variable in this book 
        will be treated as a nominal (unordered) categorical variable.

            Data were collected about students in a statistics course. Three variables were

            The number of siblings and student height represent numerical variables. Because the 
            number of siblings is a count, it is discrete. Height varies continuously, so it is a 
            continuous numerical variable. The last variable classifies students into two 
            categories<mdash />those who have and those who have not taken a statistics 
            course<mdash />which makes this variable categorical.

      <title>Relationships between variables</title>

      <p>
        Many analyses are motivated by a researcher looking for a relationship between two or 
        more variables. A social scientist may like to answer some of the following questions:
      </p>

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If homeownership is lower than the national average in one county, will the percent 
              of multi-unit structures in that county tend to be above or below the national 
              average?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Does a higher than average increase in county population tend to correspond to 
              counties with higher or lower median household incomes?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              How useful a predictor is median education level for the median household income for 
              US counties?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        To answer these questions, data must be collected, such as the <c>county</c> data set. 
        Examining summary statistics could provide insights for each of the three questions about 
        counties. Additionally, graphs can be used to visually explore data.
      </p>

      <p>
        <term>Scatterplots</term> are one type of graph used to study the relationship between 
        two numerical variables. <xref ref="fig-multiunit-homeownership"/> compares the variables 
        <c>homeownership</c> and <c>multi_unit</c>, which is the percent of units in multi-unit 
        structures (e.g. apartments, condos). Each point on the plot represents a single county. 
        For instance, the highlighted dot corresponds to County 413 in the <c>county</c> data set: 
        Chattahoochee County, Georgia, which has 39.4% of units in multi-unit structures and a 
        homeownership rate of 31.3%. The scatterplot suggests a relationship between the two 
        variables: counties with a higher rate of multi-units tend to have lower homeownership 
        rates. We might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and investigate each idea 
        to determine which are the most reasonable explanations.

            county shown on the horizontal axis and homeownership rate shown on the vertical axis. 
            The data range from 0% to almost 100% for both variables. In general, the points are 
            much more concentrated in the upper left corner of the graph and then trend downward 
            for observations further to the right while also becoming more sparse. One point is 
            annotated at the location (39.4%, 31.3%).

      <p>
        The multi-unit and homeownership rates are said to be associated because the plot shows a 
        discernible pattern. When two variables show some connection with one another, they are 
        called <term>associated</term> variables. Associated variables can also be called 
        <term>dependent</term> variables and vice-versa.

      <title>Explanatory and response variables</title>

      <p>
        When we ask questions about the relationship between two variables, we sometimes also want 
        to determine if the change in one variable causes a change in the other. Consider the 
        following rephrasing of an earlier question about the <c>county</c> data set:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>If there is an increase in the median household income in a county, does this drive 
          an increase in its population?</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In this question, we are asking whether one variable affects another. If this is our 
        underlying belief, then <em>median household income</em> is the <term>explanatory 
        variable</term> and the <em>population change</em> is the <term>response variable</term> 
        in the hypothesized relationship.<fn>Sometimes the explanatory variable is called the 
        <term>independent variable</term> and the response variable is called the 
        <term>dependent variable</term>. However, this becomes confusing since a <em>pair</em> 
        of variables might be independent or dependent, so we avoid this language.</fn>
      </p>

      <insight>
        <title>Explanatory and response variables</title>
        <p>
          When we suspect one variable might causally affect another, we label the first variable 
          the <em>explanatory variable</em> and the second the <em>response variable</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many pairs of variables, there is no hypothesized relationship, and these labels 
          would not be applied to either variable in such cases.
        </p>
      </insight>

      <p>
        Bear in mind that the act of labeling the variables in this way does nothing to ensure 
        that a causal relationship exists. A formal evaluation to check whether one variable 
        causes a change in another requires an experiment.

    </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-observational-studies-experiments">
      <title>Introducing observational studies and experiments</title>

      <p>
        There are two primary types of data collection: observational studies and experiments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Researchers perform an <term>observational study</term> when they collect data in a way 
        that does not directly interfere with how the data arise. For instance, researchers may 
        collect information via surveys, review medical records, or follow a cohort of many similar 
        individuals to study why certain diseases might develop. In each of these situations, 
        researchers merely observe the data that arise. In general, observational studies can 
        provide evidence of a naturally occurring association between variables, but they cannot 
        by themselves show a causal connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        When researchers want to investigate the possibility of a causal connection, they conduct 
        an <term>experiment</term>. Usually there will be both an explanatory and a response 
        variable. For instance, we may suspect administering a drug will reduce mortality in 
        heart attack patients over the following year. To check if there really is a causal 
        connection between the explanatory variable and the response, researchers will collect 
        a sample of individuals and split them into groups. The individuals in each group are 
        <em>assigned</em> a treatment. When individuals are randomly assigned to a group, the 
        experiment is called a <term>randomized experiment</term>. For example, each heart attack 
        patient in the drug trial could be randomly assigned, perhaps by flipping a coin, into one 
        of two groups: the first group receives a <term>placebo</term> (fake treatment) and the 
        second group receives the drug. See the case study in <xref ref="sec-stents-strokes"/> 
        for another example of an experiment, though that study did not employ a placebo.
      </p>

      <insight>
        <title>Association does not imply causation</title>
        <p>
          In general, association does not imply causation, and causation can only be inferred 
          from a randomized experiment.

In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These patients were randomly split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.

    <title>Sampling principles and strategies</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The first step in research is to pose a clear question, then decide what subjects to study and how to collect reliable data. Careful sampling is essential for trustworthy conclusions.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-populations-samples">
      <title>Populations and samples</title>

      <p>
        Each research question targets a population. Often it is too expensive to measure every case, so we select a sample—a subset of the population—to estimate the quantity of interest.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="ex-population-examples">
        <title>Identifying populations</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider: (1) the average mercury content in Atlantic swordfish, (2) the average time to degree for Duke undergrads in the last 5 years, (3) whether a new drug reduces deaths in patients with severe heart disease. Each has a population and cases; samples are used to estimate population features.

      <title>Sampling from a population</title>

        We typically use a random sample to avoid bias. In a simple random sample each case has equal chance of selection and selection of one case gives no information about others.

            A study published in the

asked a group of 200 randomly sampled men and
women to evaluate how they felt about various subjects,
such as camping, health care, architecture, taxidermy, 
crossword puzzles, and Japan in order to measure their
attitude towards mostly independent stimuli.
Then, they presented the participants with information
about a new product: a microwave oven. This microwave oven
does not exist, but the participants didn't know this,
and were given three positive and three negative fake reviews.
People who reacted positively to the subjects on the
dispositional attitude measurement also tended to react 
positively to the microwave oven, and those who reacted
negatively tended to react negatively to it.
Researchers concluded that "some people tend to 
like things, whereas others tend to dislike things, and a more thorough 
understanding of this tendency will lead to a more thorough understanding of 
the psychology of attitudes." <fn>Citation: Hepler:2013</fn>

"Researchers analyzed data from 23,123 health plan members who

when they were 50-60 years old. 23 years later, about 25% of the group had

dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that 
pack-a-day smokers were 37% more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia,

and twice the risk for more than two packs."

            To assess the effectiveness of taking large doses
of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, 
researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff
and students at a university.
A quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo,
and the rest were evenly divided between 1g Vitamin C,
3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be
taken at onset of a cold for the following two days.
All tablets had identical appearance and packaging.
The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the
patients knew which patient received which treatment,
but the researchers assessing the patients when they
were sick did not. 
No significant differences were observed in any measure
of cold duration or severity between the four groups,
and the placebo group had the shortest duration of 
symptoms.<fn>Citation: Audera:2001</fn>

            Chia Pets -- those terra-cotta 
figurines that sprout fuzzy green hair -- made the chia plant a household name. But chia 
has gained an entirely new reputation as a diet supplement. In one 2009 study, a team 
of researchers recruited 38 men and divided them randomly into two groups: treatment or 
control. They also recruited 38 women, and they randomly placed half of these 
participants into the treatment group and the other half into the control group. One 
group was given 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, and the other was given a placebo. 
The subjects volunteered to be a part of the study. After 12 weeks, the scientists found 
no significant difference between the groups in appetite or weight loss.

                A newspaper article reporting on the study states,
 "The results of this study provide proof that giving young adults
 fresh fruits and vegetables to eat can have psychological benefits,
 even over a brief period of time."
 How would you suggest revising this statement so that it can be
 supported by the study?

        <title>Screens, teens, and psychological well-being</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            In a study of three nationally representative large-scale data sets from Ireland, 
the United States, and the United Kingdom (n = 17,247), teenagers between the 
ages of 12 to 15 were asked to keep a diary of their screen time and answer questions about how they felt or acted.
The answers to these questions 
were then used to compute a psychological well-being score.
Additional data were collected and included in the analysis,
such as each child's sex and age, and on the mother’s education,
ethnicity, psychological distress, and employment.
The study concluded that there is little clear-cut evidence
that screen time decreases adolescent
well-being.<fn>Citation: orben2018screens</fn>
