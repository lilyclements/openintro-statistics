# Missing Figure: AMI Incidences Over 100 Days

This figure shows a histogram of the number of occurrences of AMI (Acute Myocardial Infarction, i.e., heart attacks) on 365 separate days in NYC, demonstrating a Poisson distribution with rate 4.4.

## Required Image
- **File**: `amiIncidencesOver100Days.png`
- **Description**: A histogram showing daily counts of AMI occurrences in NYC over a year
  - Sample mean: ~4.38
  - Sample standard deviation: ~2
  - Distribution: unimodal, skewed right
  - About 70% of data fall between 2.4 and 6.4

## Reference
Referenced in Chapter 4 (ch04.ptx) at `<xref ref="fig-ami-incidences-over-100-days"/>`

## Note
The data should be simulated as noted in the text footnote.

## TODO
This image needs to be created using R with simulated Poisson distribution data (rate = 4.4).
