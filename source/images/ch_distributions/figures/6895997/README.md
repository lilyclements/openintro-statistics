# Missing Figure: 68-95-99.7 Rule

This figure illustrates the 68-95-99.7 rule for normal distributions, showing the probabilities for falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean.

## Required Image
- **File**: `6895997.png`
- **Description**: A normal distribution curve with shaded regions showing:
  - 68% of data within 1 standard deviation
  - 95% of data within 2 standard deviations  
  - 99.7% of data within 3 standard deviations

## Reference
Referenced in Chapter 4 (ch04.ptx) at `<xref ref="fig-68-95-997"/>`

## TODO
This image needs to be created using R with the openintro package, similar to other figures in this chapter.
