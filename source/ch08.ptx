  <introduction>
    <p>
      Linear regression is a very powerful statistical technique. Many people have some familiarity with regression just from reading the news, where straight lines are overlaid on scatterplots. Linear models can be used for prediction or to evaluate whether there is a linear relationship between two numerical variables.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        It's helpful to think deeply about the line fitting process. In this section, we define the form of a linear model, explore criteria for what makes a good fit, and introduce a new statistic called <term>correlation</term>.

      <title>Fitting a line to data</title>
      
      <p>
        <xref ref="fig-perfLinearModel"/> shows two variables whose relationship can be modeled perfectly with a straight line. The equation for the line is
        <me>y = 5 + 64.96 x</me>
        Consider what a perfect linear relationship means: we know the exact value of <m>y</m> just by knowing the value of <m>x</m>. This is unrealistic in almost any natural process. For example, if we took family income (<m>x</m>), this value would provide some useful information about how much financial support a college may offer a prospective student (<m>y</m>). However, the prediction would be far from perfect, since other factors play a role in financial support beyond a family's finances.

          <description>A scatterplot with a straight line fit to the data are shown for the date December 28th, 2018. The horizontal axis is "Number of Target Corporation Stocks to Purchase" and the vertical axis is "Total Cost of the Shares Purchase". Twelve data points are shown that all fall exactly on a straight line with an equation of y equals 5 plus 64.96 times x. Because the cost is computed using a linear formula, this explains why the linear fit is perfect.</description>

      <p>
        Linear regression is the statistical method for fitting a line to data where the relationship between two variables, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, can be modeled by a straight line with some error:
        <me>y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \varepsilon</me>
        The values <m>\beta_0</m> and <m>\beta_1</m> represent the model's <term>parameters</term> (<m>\beta</m> is the Greek letter <em>beta</em>), and the error is represented by <m>\varepsilon</m> (the Greek letter <em>epsilon</em>). The parameters are estimated using data, and we write their point estimates as <m>b_0</m> and <m>b_1</m>. When we use <m>x</m> to predict <m>y</m>, we usually call <m>x</m> the <term>explanatory variable</term> or <term>predictor</term> variable, and we call <m>y</m> the <term>response</term>; we also often drop the <m>\varepsilon</m> term when writing down the model since our main focus is often on the prediction of the average outcome.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is rare for all of the data to fall perfectly on a straight line. Instead, it's more common for data to appear as a <term>cloud of points</term>, such as those examples shown in <xref ref="fig-imperfLinearModel"/>. In each case, the data fall around a straight line, even if none of the observations fall exactly on the line. The first plot shows a relatively strong downward linear trend, where the remaining variability in the data around the line is minor relative to the strength of the relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. The second plot shows an upward trend that, while evident, is not as strong as the first. The last plot shows a very weak downward trend in the data, so slight we can hardly notice it. In each of these examples, we will have some uncertainty regarding our estimates of the model parameters, <m>\beta_0</m> and <m>\beta_1</m>. For instance, we might wonder, should we move the line up or down a little, or should we tilt it more or less? As we move forward in this chapter, we will learn about criteria for line-fitting, and we will also learn about the uncertainty associated with estimates of model parameters.

          <description>Three scatterplots are shown. The first has data ranging from -50 to positive 50 on both the horizontal and vertical axes. The data start in the upper left corner of the plot and then move steadily down to the right corner. The second plot has the horizontal axis running from 500 to about 2,000 and the vertical axis from about 0 to 25,000. At the left side of the plot, the data are in the lower half of the plot, and the points generally are steadily higher as we move right, where most points near the right end of the plot are in the upper region of the plot. A upwards trending line has been fit to these points. The last plot runs from about -10 to positive 50 on the horizontal axis and about -200 to positive 400 on the vertical axis. The points are scattered broadly across the range, with only the slightest downward trend evident in the data. A trend line has been fit to this data, though it is nearly flat.</description>
        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        There are also cases where fitting a straight line to the data, even if there is a clear relationship between the variables, is not helpful. One such case is shown in <xref ref="fig-notGoodAtAllForALinearModel"/> where there is a very clear relationship between the variables even though the trend is not linear. We discuss <term>nonlinear</term> trends in this chapter and the next, but details of fitting nonlinear models are saved for a later course.

          <description>A linear model is not useful in a nonlinear set of data shown in this plot. The data are from an introductory physics experiment, where a ball is shot at many angles of inclination between 0 degrees and 90 degrees (represented by the horizontal axis), and the measured horizontal distance traveled by the ball before it hits the ground is shown in meters. The first point, at an angle of inclination of 0 hits the ground at 0 meters traveled. As the angle is increased, the ball travels further before it hits the ground until reaching a peak at 45 degrees angle of inclination, at which point it decreases again until we reach an angle of 90 degrees, at which point the ball again does not travel any horizontal distance before it hits the ground. For the data shown, the best fitting straight line is shown and is flat. This is a good example of why a straight line fit to data where there is curvature is often not useful.</description>

      <title>Using linear regression to predict possum head lengths</title>

      <p>
        Brushtail possums are a marsupial that lives in Australia, and a photo of one is shown in <xref ref="fig-brushtail-possum"/>. Researchers captured 104 of these animals and took body measurements before releasing the animals back into the wild. We consider two of these measurements: the total length of each possum, from head to tail, and the length of each possum's head.
      </p>

          <description>A common brushtail possum of Australia is shown. It has a brown fur coat with some gray sprinkled in along with a face and ears that somewhat resemble a house cat. The possum also has a big bushy tail.</description>
        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        <xref ref="fig-scattHeadLTotalL"/> shows a scatterplot for the head length and total length of the possums. Each point represents a single possum from the data. The head and total length variables are associated: possums with an above average total length also tend to have above average head lengths. While the relationship is not perfectly linear, it could be helpful to partially explain the connection between these variables with a straight line.

      <figure xml:id="fig-scattHeadLTotalL">

          <description>A scatterplot showing head length against total length for 104 brushtail possums, where the horizontal axis for total length runs from 75 centimeters to about 97 centimeters (2.5 to 3.3 feet) and the vertical axis for head length runs from about 82 millimeters up to about 104 millimeters (3 to 4 inches). For possums with a total length between 75 to 80 centimeters, there are three points shown, each with head lengths of about 85 millimeters. For possums with total length from 80 to 85 centimeters, most head lengths range from about 85 millimeters to 95 millimeters. For possums with total lengths from 85 to 90 centimeters, head lengths mostly lie between 90 millimeters and 97 millimeters. For possums with total lengths larger than 90 centimeters, the head lengths are mostly between 93 millimeters and 100 millimeters. The trend is evidently upward and approximately linear. A point representing a possum with head length 94.1mm and total length 89cm is highlighted (although not relevant for any other purpose than giving an example or reminder for how a point is read in a scatterplot).</description>
        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        We want to describe the relationship between the head length and total length variables in the possum data set using a line. In this example, we will use the total length as the predictor variable, <m>x</m>, to predict a possum's head length, <m>y</m>. We could fit the linear relationship by eye, as in <xref ref="fig-scattHeadLTotalLLine"/>. The equation for this line is
        <me>\hat{y} = 41 + 0.59x</me>
        A "hat" on <m>y</m> is used to signify that this is an estimate. We can use this line to discuss properties of possums. For instance, the equation predicts a possum with a total length of 80 cm will have a head length of
        <md>
          <mrow>\hat{y} \amp = 41 + 0.59 \times 80</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 88.2</mrow>
        </md>
        The estimate may be viewed as an average: the equation predicts that possums with a total length of 80 cm will have an average head length of 88.2 mm. Absent further information about an 80 cm possum, the prediction for head length that uses the average is a reasonable estimate.

          <description>The same scatterplot showing head length against total length for 104 brushtail possums is shown. A linear trend line has been added with an equation of y-hat equals 41 plus 0.59 times x, which shows the clear upward trajectory of the data. Additionally, three points are highlighted. The first is labeled with an "X" and is at approximately (77, 85) and lies about 1 unit below the trend line. A second point labeled with a "plus sign" is at about (85, 98) and appears to be about 7 units above the trend line. The last point highlighted is a "triangle" and is located at about (95, 93) and is about 3 units below the trend line.</description>

            Perhaps the relationship would be a little different for male possums than female possums, or perhaps it would differ for possums from one region of Australia versus another region. In <xref ref="ch-multiple-logistic-regression"/>, we'll learn about how we can include more than one predictor. Before we get there, we first need to better understand how to best build a simple linear model with one predictor.

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-residuals">
      <title>Residuals</title>
      
      <p>
        <term>Residuals</term> are the leftover variation in the data after accounting for the model fit:
        <me>\text{Data} = \text{Fit} + \text{Residual}</me>
        Each observation will have a residual, and three of the residuals for the linear model we fit for the possum data is shown in <xref ref="fig-scattHeadLTotalLLine"/>. If an observation is above the regression line, then its residual, the vertical distance from the observation to the line, is positive. Observations below the line have negative residuals. One goal in picking the right linear model is for these residuals to be as small as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's look closer at the three residuals featured in <xref ref="fig-scattHeadLTotalLLine"/>. The observation marked by an "<m>\times</m>" has a small, negative residual of about -1; the observation marked by "<m>+</m>" has a large residual of about +7; and the observation marked by "<m>\triangle</m>" has a moderate residual of about -4. The size of a residual is usually discussed in terms of its absolute value. For example, the residual for "<m>\triangle</m>" is larger than that of "<m>\times</m>" because <m>|-4|</m> is larger than <m>|-1|</m>.

            The linear fit shown in <xref ref="fig-scattHeadLTotalLLine"/> is given as <m>\hat{y} = 41 + 0.59x</m>. Based on this line, formally compute the residual of the observation <m>(77.0, 85.3)</m>. This observation is denoted by "<m>\times</m>" in <xref ref="fig-scattHeadLTotalLLine"/>.

            We first compute the predicted value of point "<m>\times</m>" based on the model:
            <me>\hat{y}_{\times} = 41 + 0.59x_{\times} = 41 + 0.59 \times 77.0 = 86.4</me>
            Next we compute the difference of the actual head length and the predicted head length:
            <me>e_{\times} = y_{\times} - \hat{y}_{\times} = 85.3 - 86.4 = -1.1</me>
            The model's error is <m>e_{\times} = -1.1</m> mm, which is very close to the visual estimate of -1 mm. The negative residual indicates that the linear model overpredicted head length for this particular possum.

        Residuals are helpful in evaluating how well a linear model fits a data set. We often display them in a <term>residual plot</term> such as the one shown in <xref ref="fig-scattHeadLTotalLResidualPlot"/> for the regression line in <xref ref="fig-scattHeadLTotalLLine"/>. The residuals are plotted at their original horizontal locations but with the vertical coordinate as the residual. For instance, the point <m>(85.0, 98.6)_{+}</m> had a residual of 7.45, so in the residual plot it is placed at <m>(85.0, 7.45)</m>. Creating a residual plot is sort of like tipping the scatterplot over so the regression line is horizontal.

There is no evident trend in the residuals. Three points are specifically highlighted to reflect the three points discussed in the last figure. The first is labeled with an "X" with a total length of 77 and a residual of about -1. The second is labeled with a "plus sign" and has a total length of 85 and a residual of about 7.

            The second data set shows a pattern in the residuals. There is some curvature in the scatterplot, which is more obvious in the residual plot. We should not use a straight line to model these data. Instead, a more advanced technique should be used.

            The last plot shows very little upwards trend, and the residuals also show no obvious patterns. It is reasonable to try to fit a linear model to the data. However, it is unclear whether there is statistically significant evidence that the slope parameter is different from zero. The point estimate of the slope parameter, labeled <m>b_1</m>, is not zero, but we might wonder if this could just be due to chance.

The bottom left plot is the residual plot of this first scatterplot, and it likewise shows no pattern in the residuals when looking left to right. The upper middle plot shows data with a downward trend, but the data's trend is more steep on the right side of the plot, so the overall shape of the data is that it trends downward and curves downward. A straight, downward-trending line has also been fit to this data, but it doesn't fit as well. The data are below this downward trending line initially, but it is above the line in the middle, and finally on the right it is once again below the linear trend line. The residual plot for this scatterplot is shown in the lower middle plot, and the curvature in the residuals is more evident than what was visible in the scatterplot: the residuals have negative values on the left and trend upwards until peaking with positive residuals in the middle, and then trending back down and having negative residual values again on the right. The last scatterplot in the upper right shows data with very little trend, but a slightly-upward trending straight line has been fit to the data. The corresponding residual plot, shown as the bottom right plot, also shows data with no evident trend or pattern, where observations appear relatively randomly scattered above and below 0 (in the vertical).</description>

          <description>Eight scatterplots are shown, each with their correlation noted. Each scatterplot appears to represent about 50 points. The first has a correlation of R equals 0.33, and there is a slight upward trend evident in the data -- if a trend line were drawn for this data, much of the data would fall relatively far from the line. The second plot has a correlation of R equals 0.69, and a clearer upward trend is evident, but it is still pretty volatile with many points deviating far from where the trend line would be. The third plot has a correlation of 0.98, and the data show a very clear upward trend, where if a trend line were drawn, the data would be (relatively) quite close to this line. The fourth plot shows a correlation of R equals 1.00, and here the points appear exactly on a line with an upward trajectory. The fifth plot shows data with a correlation of R equals 0.08, where no trend is visually evident in the data. The sixth plot has a correlation of R equals -0.64, and a downward trend is evident in the data, but the individual observations would in many cases be pretty distant from any trend line fit to the data (on a relative basis). The seventh plot has a correlation of R equals -0.92 and shows data with a clear downward trend, where the data would deviate just a modest amount from a trend line fit to the data. The last plot shows a correlation of R equals -1, where the observations would fit exactly on a line trending downwards.</description>

        The correlation is intended to quantify the strength of a linear trend. Nonlinear trends, even when strong, sometimes produce correlations that do not reflect the strength of the relationship; see three such examples in <xref ref="fig-corForNonLinearPlots"/>.

          <description>Three scatterplots are shown. In each case, there is a strong relationship between the variables. However, because the relationship is nonlinear, the correlation is relatively weak. The first plot shows data that trends upwards on the left before peaking and then trending downward on the right -- the correlation of the data in this plot is R equals -0.23. The second plot shows data with a sharp downward trend on the left before reaching a trough and rising then sharply upward before reaching a peak and then trending sharply downwards again -- the correlation of the data in this plot is R equals 0.31. The third plot shows data that without a trend on the far left, followed by a steep drop, a trough, and then a steep rise to a peak, and then another drop and then finally a slight increase at the end -- the correlation of the data in this plot is R equals 0.50.</description>

First, it is worth noting that there several points along the bottom of the plot with a fastest speed of 0 mph. The remainder of the description will concentrate on the other points. A small portion of the points are shown with heights below 60 inches, and these have fastest speeds mostly ranging from about 70 to 110 mph. For points shown with heights between 60 and 70, fastest speeds mostly ranged from about 30 to 120 mph. For points shown with heights of 70 or more, fastest speeds mostly ranged from about 50 to 140 mph. There were no points corresponding to heights greater than 75 that had fastest speeds slower than about 75 mph, which left a sort of gap in the lower right portion of the scatterplot.</description>

Infants born during the study year were split into twelve groups, one for each birth month. We consider the average crawling age of babies in each group against the average temperature when the babies are six months old (that's when babies often begin trying to crawl).

      <p>
        This section considers family income and gift aid data from a random sample of fifty students in the freshman class of Elmhurst College in Illinois. Gift aid is financial aid that does not need to be paid back, as opposed to a loan. A scatterplot of the data is shown in <xref ref="fig-elmhurstScatterW2Lines"/> along with two linear fits. The lines follow a negative trend in the data; students who have higher family incomes tended to have lower gift aid from the university.

          <description>A scatterplot is shown for a random sample of 50 freshman students from Elmhurst College. The horizontal axis is for "family income" and has values ranging from $0 to about $300,000. The vertical axis is for "gift aid" and has values ranging from $0 to about $35,000. Two lines are fit to the data showing a slight downward trend. One of those lines is a solid line representing what is called the "least squares line". About 10 observations are shown where family income is between $0 and $50,000, and gift aid for these values is roughly between $17,000 and $28,000. About 20 observations are shown where family income is between $50,000 and $100,000, and gift aid for these values is roughly between $10,000 and $33,000. About 10 observations are shown where family income is between $100,000 and $150,000, and gift aid for these values is roughly between $9,000 and $25,000. Three observations are shown where family income is between $150,000 and $200,000, and gift aid for these values are $25,000, $12,000, and $13,000. Six more observations are shown where family income is larger than $200,000, and gift aid for these values ranges from about $7,000 to $22,000. The data in this graph will be frequently discussed throughout this section and referred to as the "Elmhurst data".</description>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-least-squares-criterion">
      <title>An objective measure for finding the best line</title>
      
      <p>
        We begin by thinking about what we mean by <q>best</q>. Mathematically, we want a line that has small residuals. The first option that may come to mind is to minimize the sum of the residual magnitudes:
        <me>|e_1| + |e_2| + \dots + |e_n|</me>
        which we could accomplish with a computer program. The resulting dashed line shown in <xref ref="fig-elmhurstScatterW2Lines"/> demonstrates this fit can be quite reasonable. However, a more common practice is to choose the line that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals:
        <me>e_{1}^2 + e_{2}^2 + \dots + e_{n}^2</me>
      </p>

      <p>
        The line that minimizes this <term>least squares criterion</term> is represented as the solid line in <xref ref="fig-elmhurstScatterW2Lines"/>. This is commonly called the <term>least squares line</term>. The following are three possible reasons to choose this option instead of trying to minimize the sum of residual magnitudes without any squaring:
        <ol>
          <li><p>It is the most commonly used method.</p></li>
          <li><p>Computing the least squares line is widely supported in statistical software.</p></li>
          <li><p>In many applications, a residual twice as large as another residual is more than twice as bad. For example, being off by 4 is usually more than twice as bad as being off by 2. Squaring the residuals accounts for this discrepancy.</p></li>
        </ol>
        The first two reasons are largely for tradition and convenience; the last reason explains why the least squares criterion is typically most helpful.<fn>There are applications where the sum of residual magnitudes may be more useful, and there are plenty of other criteria we might consider. However, this book only applies the least squares criterion.</fn>

            <title>Linearity</title>

            <title>Nearly normal residuals</title>
            <p>Generally, the residuals must be nearly normal.

            <p>The variability of points around the least squares line remains roughly constant. An example of non-constant variability is shown in the third panel of <xref ref="fig-whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel"/>, which represents the most common pattern observed when this condition fails: the variability of <m>y</m> is larger when <m>x</m> is larger.</p>

Such data may have an underlying structure that should be considered in a model and analysis. An example of a data set where successive observations are not independent is shown in the fourth panel of <xref ref="fig-whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel"/>.

          <description>Four scatterplots are shown, each with their own residual plot. These four examples show when methods in this chapter are insufficient to apply to the data. In the first set, a scatterplot with arch-shaped data is shown with a straight line fit to the data, which poorly fits the curved nature of the data; this is meant to highlight an example where "linearity" fails. In the second set, a set of data with a line fit is shown, where the data tightly pack around the line, except one point in particular that is far from the line and represents the case where there are "extreme outliers" in the data. The third set shows a case where a straight line fits the data, but the variability around the line changes, where observations tend to be quite close to the line on the left, but when looking further right, the observations tend to be increasingly far from the line, indicating "changing variability" in the residuals over different regions of the plot. The fourth set provides another case of what is called "time series" data, which is a context where "successive observations are correlated".</description>

      <title>Finding the least squares line</title>
      
      <p>
        For the Elmhurst data, we could write the equation of the least squares regression line as
        <me>\widehat{\text{aid}} = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}\times \text{family\_income}</me>
        Here the equation is set up to predict gift aid based on a student's family income, which would be useful to students considering Elmhurst. These two values, <m>\beta_0</m> and <m>\beta_1</m>, are the parameters of the regression line.
      </p>

      <p>
        As in Chapters 4, 5, and 6, the parameters are estimated using observed data. In practice, this estimation is done using a computer in the same way that other estimates, like a sample mean, can be estimated using a computer or calculator. However, we can also find the parameter estimates by applying two properties of the least squares line:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The slope of the least squares line can be estimated by
            <me>b_1 = \frac{s_y}{s_x} R</me>
            where <m>R</m> is the correlation between the two variables, and <m>s_x</m> and <m>s_y</m> are the sample standard deviations of the explanatory variable and response, respectively.</p>

      <title>Interpreting regression model parameter estimates</title>
      
      <p>
        Interpreting parameters in a regression model is often one of the most important steps in the analysis.

      <example xml:id="ex-interpret-elmhurst-parameters">
        <statement>
          <p>
            The intercept and slope estimates for the Elmhurst data are <m>b_0 = 24,319</m> and <m>b_1 = -0.0431</m>. What do these numbers really mean?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Interpreting the slope parameter is helpful in almost any application. For each additional $1,000 of family income, we would expect a student to receive a net difference of <m>\$1,000\times (-0.0431) = -\$43.10</m> in aid on average, i.e. $43.10 <em>less</em>. Note that a higher family income corresponds to less aid because the coefficient of family income is negative in the model. We must be cautious in this interpretation: while there is a real association, we cannot interpret a causal connection between the variables because these data are observational. That is, increasing a student's family income may not cause the student's aid to drop. (It would be reasonable to contact the college and ask if the relationship is causal, i.e. if Elmhurst College's aid decisions are partially based on students' family income.)
          </p>

          <p>
            The estimated intercept <m>b_0 = 24,319</m> describes the average aid if a student's family had no income. The meaning of the intercept is relevant to this application since the family income for some students at Elmhurst is $0. In other applications, the intercept may have little or no practical value if there are no observations where <m>x</m> is near zero.

        Linear models can be used to approximate the relationship between two variables. However, these models have real limitations. Linear regression is simply a modeling framework. The truth is almost always much more complex than our simple line. For example, we do not know how the data outside of our limited window will behave.

        The <m>R^2</m> of a linear model describes the amount of variation in the response that is explained by the least squares line.

The variance of the response variable, aid received, is about <m>s_{\text{aid}}^2 \approx 29.8</m> million. However, if we apply our least squares line, then this model reduces our uncertainty in predicting aid using a student's family income. The variability in the residuals describes how much variation remains after using the model: <m>s_{_{RES}}^2 \approx 22.4</m> million. In short, there was a reduction of
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{s_{\text{aid}}^2 - s_{_{RES}}^2}{s_{\text{aid}}^2} \amp = \frac{29,800,000 - 22,400,000}{29,800,000}</mrow>

      <p>
        Categorical variables are also useful in predicting outcomes. Here we consider a categorical predictor with two levels (recall that a <em>level</em> is the same as a <em>category</em>). We'll consider Ebay auctions for a video game, <em>Mario Kart</em> for the Nintendo Wii, where both the total price of the auction and the condition of the game were recorded. Here we want to predict total price based on game condition, which takes values <c>used</c> and <c>new</c>. A plot of the auction data is shown in <xref ref="fig-marioKartNewUsed"/>.

      <figure xml:id="fig-marioKartNewUsed">

        <image source="ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/marioKartNewUsed" width="60%">
          <description>A scatterplot is shown for total auction prices for the video game "Mario Kart", broken down by condition on the horizontal axis. The prices are divided into "used" and "new" condition groups. All used games are shown with an x-value of 0 on the left, and all new games are shown with an x-value of 1 on the right of the plot. The used games on the left show a lower average price of about $43, and new games on the right show a higher average price of about $54. The least squares regression line is also shown for this scatterplot, which shows an upward trend and has a formula of "price equals 42.87 plus 10.90 times cond-subscript-new.</description>
        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>
        To incorporate the game condition variable into a regression equation, we must convert the categories into a numerical form. We will do so using an <term>indicator variable</term> called <c>cond_new</c>, which takes value 1 when the game is new and 0 when the game is used. Using this indicator variable, the linear model may be written as
        <me>\widehat{\text{price}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{cond\_new}</me>
        The parameter estimates are given in <xref ref="fig-marioKartNewUsedRegrSummary"/>, and the model equation can be summarized as
        <me>\widehat{\text{price}} = 42.87 + 10.90 \times \text{cond\_new}</me>
        For categorical predictors with just two levels, the linearity assumption will always be satisfied. However, we must evaluate whether the residuals in each group are approximately normal and have approximately equal variance. As can be seen in <xref ref="fig-marioKartNewUsed"/>, both of these conditions are reasonably satisfied by the auction data.

          The estimated intercept is the value of the response variable for the first category (i.e. the category corresponding to an indicator value of 0). The estimated slope is the average change in the response variable between the two categories.

              <description>A scatterplot with a least squares regression line is fit based on about 50 points. The horizontal axis represents "Number of tourists" and has values ranging from about 0 to about 27 million. The vertical axis represents "Spending, in US dollars", with values ranging from about $0 to about $17 billion. There are many points shown with the number of tourists between 0 and 5 million, which has spending between about $0 and $3 billion, where even on this small scale a roughly linear trend is evident. The linear trend continues on across the plot and is quite strong -- where residuals generally do not deviate from the least square line by more than very roughly $1 billion. The data are also more sparse for larger values in the plot. There is one region in the center of the plot where about 10 points in a row lie above the regression line.

  <!-- Section 8.3: Outliers in linear regression -->
  <section xml:id="sec-outliers-in-regression">
    <title>Types of outliers in linear regression</title>
    
    <p>
      In this section, we identify criteria for determining which outliers are important and influential. Outliers in regression are observations that fall far from the cloud of points. These points are especially important because they can have a strong influence on the least squares line.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="outlierPlotsExample">
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are six plots shown in <xref ref="outlierPlots"/> along with the least squares line and residual plots. For each scatterplot and residual plot pair, identify the outliers and note how they influence the least squares line. Recall that an outlier is any point that doesn't appear to belong with the vast majority of the other points.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                There is one outlier far from the other points, though it only appears to slightly influence the line.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                There is one outlier on the right, though it is quite close to the least squares line, which suggests it wasn't very influential.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                There is one point far away from the cloud, and this outlier appears to pull the least squares line up on the right; examine how the line around the primary cloud doesn't appear to fit very well.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                There is a primary cloud and then a small secondary cloud of four outliers. The secondary cloud appears to be influencing the line somewhat strongly, making the least square line fit poorly almost everywhere. There might be an interesting explanation for the dual clouds, which is something that could be investigated.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                There is no obvious trend in the main cloud of points and the outlier on the right appears to largely control the slope of the least squares line.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                There is one outlier far from the cloud. However, it falls quite close to the least squares line and does not appear to be very influential.

        <description>Six scatterplots, each with a least squares line and residual plot. All data sets have at least one outlier. (1) A clear positive upward trend is evident in the points with a regression line overlaying these points, but one point is shown deviating substantially from the line about one-third of the way from the left side of the plot and far below the other points. (2) A slight downward trend is evident in the points on the left half of the plot with a regression line overlaying these points and extending to a single point on the far right of the plot that is also very close to the regression line. (3) A positive upward trend is evident for points shown on the left two-thirds of the plot with a regression line overlaying these points, but a single point is shown on the far right and lying substantially above the line. This one point appears to be "pulling" the regression line up on the right, making the line fit the rest of the data less well. (4) Most of the data is shown in the left two-thirds of the plot with a clear downward, linear trend. A cluster of 4 points is shown on the far right but deviating notably above the trend of the other points. The regression line fit to the data shows it largely "trying" to fit the bulk of the data on the left but being "pulled" upward on the right towards the cluster of points deviating from the linear trend. (5) A large cluster of points is shown on the far bottom-left, and there is no apparent trend in this large cluster. A single point is shown on the far upper-right. A regression line is fit to the data with a line extending from the cluster on the bottom-left and trending upwards near the single point on the upper right. (6) A clear downward trend is evident in the points on the right two-thirds of the plot with a regression line overlaying these points and extending to a single point on the far left of the plot that is also very close to the regression line.</description>

    <p>
      Examine the residual plots in <xref ref="outlierPlots"/>. You will probably find that there is some trend in the main clouds of (3) and (4). In these cases, the outliers influenced the slope of the least squares lines. In (5), data with no clear trend were assigned a line with a large trend simply due to one outlier (!).
    </p>

    <assemblage xml:id="leverage-box">
      <title>Leverage</title>
      <p>
        Points that fall horizontally away from the center of the cloud tend to pull harder on the line, so we call them points with <term>high leverage</term>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      Points that fall horizontally far from the line are points of high leverage; these points can strongly influence the slope of the least squares line. If one of these high leverage points does appear to actually invoke its influence on the slope of the line<mdash/>as in cases (3), (4), and (5) of <xref ref="outlierPlotsExample"/><mdash/>then we call it an <term>influential point</term>. Usually we can say a point is influential if, had we fitted the line without it, the influential point would have been unusually far from the least squares line.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is tempting to remove outliers. Don't do this without a very good reason. Models that ignore exceptional (and interesting) cases often perform poorly. For instance, if a financial firm ignored the largest market swings<mdash/>the <q>outliers</q><mdash/>they would soon go bankrupt by making poorly thought-out investments.

  <section xml:id="sec-inference-for-regression">
    <title>Inference for linear regression</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this section, we discuss uncertainty in the estimates of the slope and y-intercept for a regression line. Just as we identified standard errors for point estimates in previous chapters, we first discuss standard errors for these new estimates.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-midterm-elections-unemployment">
      <title>Midterm elections and unemployment</title>
      
      <p>
        Elections for members of the United States House of Representatives occur every two years, coinciding every four years with the U.S. Presidential election. The set of House elections occurring during the middle of a Presidential term are called <term>midterm elections</term>. In America's two-party system, one political theory suggests the higher the unemployment rate, the worse the President's party will do in the midterm elections.
      </p>

      <p>
        To assess the validity of this claim, we can compile historical data and look for a connection. We consider every midterm election from 1898 to 2018, with the exception of those elections during the Great Depression. <xref ref="fig-unemploymentAndChangeInHouse"/> shows these data and the least-squares regression line:
        <md>
          <mrow>\amp\text{% change in House seats for President's party}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp\qquad\qquad= -7.36 - 0.89 \times \text{(unemployment rate)}</mrow>
        </md>
        We consider the percent change in the number of seats of the President's party (e.g. percent change in the number of seats for Republicans in 2018) against the unemployment rate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Examining the data, there are no clear deviations from linearity, the constant variance condition, or substantial outliers. While the data are collected sequentially, a separate analysis was used to check for any apparent correlation between successive observations; no such correlation was found.
      </p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-unemploymentAndChangeInHouse">
        <caption>The percent change in House seats for the President's party in each midterm election from 1898 to 2018 plotted against the unemployment rate. The two points for the Great Depression have been removed, and a least squares regression line has been fit to the data.</caption>

          <description>A scatterplot is shown for the percent change in House seats for the President's party in each midterm election from 1898 to 2018 plotted against the unemployment rate. The two points for the Great Depression have been removed, and a least squares regression line has been fit to the data with a slightly downward trend. The horizontal axis is for "Unemployment Rate" with values ranging from about 3% to 12%. The vertical axis is for "Percent Change in Seats of the President's Party in the House of Representatives" with values ranging from about -30% to positive 10%. The bulk of the observations have Unemployment Rate between 3% and 8%, and these have the percent change in seats ranging from about -27% to positive 4% without any discernible trend. There are four observations with unemployment rate above 8%, and these have the percent change in seats ranging from -25% to -9%. Each point in the scatterplot is also labeled as "Democrat" in blue or "Republican" in red, though this doesn't reveal any additional pattern.</description>

        <statement>
          <p>
            The data for the Great Depression (1934 and 1938) were removed because the unemployment rate was 21% and 18%, respectively. Do you agree that they should be removed for this investigation? Why or why not?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We will provide two considerations. Each of these points would have very high leverage on any least-squares regression line, and years with such high unemployment may not help us understand what would happen in other years where the unemployment is only modestly high. On the other hand, these are exceptional cases, and we would be discarding important information if we exclude them from a final analysis.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </exercise>

      <p>
        There is a negative slope in the line shown in <xref ref="fig-unemploymentAndChangeInHouse"/>. However, this slope (and the y-intercept) are only estimates of the parameter values. We might wonder, is this convincing evidence that the <q>true</q> linear model has a negative slope? That is, do the data provide strong evidence that the political theory is accurate, where the unemployment rate is a useful predictor of the midterm election? We can frame this investigation into a statistical hypothesis test:
        <ul>
          <li><m>H_0</m>: <m>\beta_1 = 0</m>. The true linear model has slope zero.</li>
          <li><m>H_A</m>: <m>\beta_1 \neq 0</m>. The true linear model has a slope different than zero. The unemployment is predictive of whether the President's party wins or loses seats in the House of Representatives.</li>
        </ul>
        We would reject <m>H_0</m> in favor of <m>H_A</m> if the data provide strong evidence that the true slope parameter is different than zero. To assess the hypotheses, we identify a standard error for the estimate, compute an appropriate test statistic, and identify the p-value.

      <title>Understanding regression output from software</title>
      
      <p>
        Just like other point estimates we have seen before, we can compute a standard error and test statistic for <m>b_1</m>. We will generally label the test statistic using a <m>T</m>, since it follows the <m>t</m>-distribution.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will rely on statistical software to compute the standard error and leave the explanation of how this standard error is determined to a second or third statistics course. <xref ref="fig-midtermUnempRegTable"/> shows software output for the least squares regression line in <xref ref="fig-unemploymentAndChangeInHouse"/>.

            The entries in the first column represent the least squares estimates, <m>b_0</m> and <m>b_1</m>, and the values in the second column correspond to the standard errors of each estimate. Using the estimates, we could write the equation for the least square regression line as
            <me>\hat{y} = -7.3644 - 0.8897 x</me>
            where <m>\hat{y}</m> in this case represents the predicted change in the number of seats for the president's party, and <m>x</m> represents the unemployment rate.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

      <p>
        We previously used a <m>t</m>-test statistic for hypothesis testing in the context of numerical data. Regression is very similar. In the hypotheses we consider, the null value for the slope is 0, so we can compute the test statistic using the T (or Z) score formula:
        <me>T = \frac{\text{estimate} - \text{null value}}{\text{SE}} = \frac{-0.8897 - 0}{0.8350} = -1.07</me>
        This corresponds to the third column of <xref ref="fig-midtermUnempRegTable"/>.

        <solution>
          <p>
            The last column of the table gives the p-value for the two-sided hypothesis test for the coefficient of the unemployment rate: 0.2961. That is, the data do not provide convincing evidence that a higher unemployment rate has any correspondence with smaller or larger losses for the President's party in the House of Representatives in midterm elections.

The p-value corresponds exactly to the two-sided test we are interested in: 0.0002. The p-value is so small that we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that family income and financial aid at Elmhurst College for freshman entering in the year 2011 are negatively correlated and the true slope parameter is indeed less than 0, just as we believed in <xref ref="ex-elmhurst-slope-assessment"/>.

      <title>Confidence interval for a coefficient</title>
      
      <p>
        Similar to how we can conduct a hypothesis test for a model coefficient using regression output, we can also construct a confidence interval for that coefficient.
      </p>

      <example xml:id="ex-ci-for-family-income">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Compute the 95% confidence interval for the <c>family_income</c> coefficient using the regression output from <xref ref="fig-rOutputForIncomeAidLSRLineInInferenceSection"/>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The point estimate is -0.0431 and the standard error is <m>SE = 0.0108</m>. When constructing a confidence interval for a model coefficient, we generally use a <m>t</m>-distribution. The degrees of freedom for the distribution are noted in the regression output, <m>df = 48</m>, allowing us to identify <m>t_{48}^{\star} = 2.01</m> for use in the confidence interval.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can now construct the confidence interval in the usual way:
            <md>
              <mrow>\text{point estimate} \pm t_{48}^{\star} \times SE \amp\to -0.0431 \pm 2.01 \times 0.0108</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp\to (-0.0648, -0.0214)</mrow>
            </md>
            We are 95% confident that with each dollar increase in <c>family_income</c>, the university's gift aid is predicted to decrease on average by $0.0214 to $0.0648.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>

        <title>Confidence intervals for coefficients</title>

          where <m>t_{df}^{\star}</m> is the appropriate <m>t</m>-value corresponding to the confidence level with the model's degrees of freedom.

        On the topic of intervals in this book, we've focused exclusively on confidence intervals for model parameters.

        <title>Beer and blood alcohol content</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Many people believe that gender, weight, drinking habits, and many other factors are much more important in predicting blood alcohol content (BAC) than simply considering the number of drinks a person consumed. Here we examine data from sixteen student volunteers at Ohio State University who each drank a randomly assigned number of cans of beer. These students were evenly divided between men and women, and they differed in weight and drinking habits. Thirty minutes later, a police officer measured their blood alcohol content (BAC) in grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood. The scatterplot and regression table summarize the findings.

The point at 1 can of beer is at 0.01 BAC, lower than any other values. For the four points at 2 and 3 cans of beer, BAC ranges from 0.02 to 0.07. For the six points at 4 and 5 cans of beer, BAC ranges from 0.05 to 0.10. Two points are at 7 cans of beer and have BAC of 0.09 and 0.10. There is a single point for 8 cans of beer, which has a BAC of 0.12, and one last point at 9 cans of beer, which has a BAC of about 0.19.</description>

            instructor. Researchers at University of Texas, Austin collected data on teaching evaluation 
            score (higher score means better) and standardized beauty score (a score of 0 means average, 
            negative score means below average, and a positive score means above average) for a sample of 
            463 professors. The scatterplot below shows the relationship between these variables, and 
            regression output is provided for predicting teaching evaluation score from beauty score.

                      Given that the average standardized beauty score is -0.0883 and average teaching 
                      evaluation score is 3.9983, calculate the slope. Alternatively, the slope may be 
                      computed using just the information provided in the model summary table.

                      Do these data provide convincing evidence that the slope of the relationship between

                <description>A scatterplot is shown for several hundred points. The horizontal axis is for a "Beauty" score and takes values between -1.8 and positive 2. The vertical axis is for "Teaching evaluation" and takes values between 2 and 5. For beauty scores smaller than 0, the Teaching Evaluation scores range mostly between 2.5 and 4.8, with no obvious trend in this region of the data. For beauty scores between 0 and 1, the Teaching Evaluation scores range mostly between 3 and 4.7. For beauty scores between 1 and 2, the Teaching Evaluation scores range mostly between 3.2 and 4.8.</description>
