  <title>Inference for categorical data</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this chapter, we apply the methods and ideas from Chapter \ref{ch_foundations_for_inf</p>
    <p>in several contexts for categorical data. We'll start by revisiting what we learned for a single proportion, where the normal distribution can be used to model the uncertainty in the sample proportion. Next, we apply these same ideas to analyze the difference of two proportions using the normal model. Later in the chapter, we apply inference techniques to contingency tables; while we will use a different distribution in this context, the core ideas of hypothesis testing remain the same.}</p>

    <title>Inference for a single proportion</title>

    <p>We encountered inference methods for a single proportion in <xref ref="ch_foundations_for_inf"/>, exploring point estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests. In this section, we'll do a review of these topics and also how to choose an appropriate sample size when collecting data for single proportion contexts.</p>
    <subsection xml:id="">
      <title>Identifying when the sample proportion is nearly normal</title>
      <p>A sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> can be modeled using a normal distribution when the sample observations are independent and the sample size is sufficiently large.</p>
      <assemblage>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>The sample's observations are independent, e.g. are from a simple random sample.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>We expected to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, i.e. <m>np\geq10</m> and <m>n(1-p)\geq10</m>. This is called the <term>success-failure condition</term>.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>When these conditions are met, then the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> is nearly normal with mean <m>p</m> and standard error % <m>SE = \sqrt{\frac{\ p(1-p)\ }{n}}</m>.</p>
      </assemblage>

      <p>Typically we don't know the true proportion <m>p</m>, so we substitute some value to check conditions and estimate the standard error. For confidence intervals, the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> is used to check the success-failure condition and compute the standard error. For hypothesis tests, typically the null value – that is, the proportion claimed in the null hypothesis – is used in place of <m>p</m>.</p>

      <title>Confidence intervals for a proportion</title>
      <p>A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the parameter <m>p</m>, and when <m>\hat{p}</m> can be modeled using a normal distribution, the confidence interval for <m>p</m> takes the form</p>
      <me>\hat{p} \pm z^{\star} \times SE</me>
      <example xml:id="">
        <title>A simple random sample of 826{</title>
        <p>payday loan borrowers was surveyed to better understand their interests around regulation and costs. 70 percent of the responses supported new regulations on payday lenders. Is it reasonable to model <m>\hat{p} = 0.70</m> using a normal distribution?} The data are a random sample, so the observations are independent and representative of the population of interest.</p>
        <p>We also must check the success-failure condition, which we do using <m>\hat{p}</m> in place of <m>p</m> when computing a confidence interval:</p>
        <me>\text{Support: } n p & \approx \paydayN{} \times \paydayRegProp{} = 578 &\text{Not: } n (1 - p) & \approx \paydayN{} \times (1 - \paydayRegProp{}) = 248</me>
        <p>Since both values are at least 10, we can use the normal distribution to model <m>\hat{p}</m>.</p>
      </example>

      <p>\footnotetext{$SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{0.70 (1 - 0.70)} {826}} = 0.016$.}</p>

      <title>Hypothesis testing for a proportion</title>
      <p>One possible regulation for payday lenders is that they would be required to do a credit check and evaluate debt payments against the borrower's finances. We would like to know: would borrowers support this form of regulation?</p>
      <p>\footnotetext{<m>H_0</m>: <m>p = 0.50</m>. <m>H_A</m>: <m>p \neq 0.50</m>.}</p>
      <p>To apply the normal distribution framework in the context of a hypothesis test for a proportion, the independence and success-failure conditions must be satisfied. In a hypothesis test, the success-failure condition is checked using the null proportion: we verify <m>np_0</m> and <m>n(1-p_0)</m> are at least 10, where <m>p_0</m> is the null value.</p>
      <p>\footnotetext{Independence holds since the poll is based on a random sample. The success-failure condition also holds, which is checked using the null value (<m>p_0 = 0.5</m>) from <m>H_0</m>: <m>np_0 = 826 \times 0.5 = 826Half</m>, <m>n(1 - p_0) = 826 \times 0.5 = 826Half</m>.}</p>

The standard error in the context of a one-proportion hypothesis test is computed using the null value, <m>p_0</m>:</p>
        <me>SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5 (1 - 0.5)}{\paydayN{}}} = \paydayCCSE{}</me>

    <subsection xml:id="">
      <title>When one or more conditions aren't met</title>
      <p>We've spent a lot of time discussing conditions for when <m>\hat{p}</m> can be reasonably modeled by a normal distribution. What happens when the success-failure condition fails? What about when the independence condition fails? In either case, the general ideas of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests remain the same, but the strategy or technique used to generate the interval or p-value change.</p>
      <p>When the success-failure condition isn't met for a hypothesis test, we can simulate the null distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> using the null value, <m>p_0</m>. The simulation concept is similar to the ideas used in the malaria case study presented in <xref ref="caseStudyMalariaVaccine"/>, and an online section outlines this strategy: \begin{center} \oiRedirect{stat_sim_prop_ht} {www.openintro.org/r?go=stat_sim_prop_ht} \end{center} For a confidence interval when the success-failure condition isn't met, we can use what's called the <term>Clopper-Pearson interval</term>. The details are beyond the scope of this book. However, there are many internet resources covering this topic.</p>
      <p>The independence condition is a more nuanced requirement. When it isn't met, it is important to understand how and why it isn't met. For example, if we took a cluster sample (see <xref ref="section_obs_data_sampling"/>), suitable statistical methods are available but would be beyond the scope of even most second or third courses in statistics. On the other hand, we'd be stretched to find any method that we could confidently apply to correct the inherent biases of data from a convenience sample.</p>
      <p>While this book is scoped to well-constrained statistical problems, do remember that this is just the first book in what is a large library of statistical methods that are suitable for a very wide range of data and contexts.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="">
      <title>Choosing a sample size when estimating a proportion</title>
      <p>When collecting data, we choose a sample size suitable for the purpose of the study. Often times this means choosing a sample size large enough that the <term>margin of error</term> – which is the part we add and subtract from the point estimate in a confidence interval – is sufficiently small that the sample is useful. For example, our task might be to find a sample size <m>n</m> so that the sample proportion is within <m>\pm 0.04</m> of the actual proportion in a 95 percent confidence interval.</p>
      <example xml:id="">
        <p>a survey to determine what fraction of students support a \$200 per year increase in fees to pay for a new football stadium. How big of a sample is required to ensure the margin of error is smaller than 0.04 using a 95 percent confidence level?} The margin of error for a sample proportion is</p>
        <me>z^{\star} \sqrt{\frac{p (1 - p)}{n}}</me>
        <p>Our goal is to find the smallest sample size <m>n</m> so that this margin of error is smaller than <m>0.04</m>. For a 95 percent confidence level, the value <m>z^{\star}</m> corresponds to 1.96:</p>
        <me>1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \ < \ 0.04</me>
        <p>There are two unknowns in the equation: <m>p</m> and <m>n</m>. If we have an estimate of <m>p</m>, perhaps from a prior survey, we could enter in that value and solve for <m>n</m>. If we have no such estimate, we must use some other value for <m>p</m>. It turns out that the margin of error is largest when <m>p</m> is 0.5, so we typically use this <em>worst case value</em> if no estimate of the proportion is available:</p>
        <md>
          <mrow>1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{n}} &\ < \ 0.04</mrow>
          <mrow>1.96^2\times \frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{n} &\ < \ 0.04^2</mrow>
          <mrow>1.96^2\times \frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{0.04^2} &\ < \ n</mrow>
          <mrow>600.25 &\ < \  n</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>We would need over 600.25 participants, which means we need 601 participants or more, to ensure the sample proportion is within 0.04 of the true proportion with 95 percent confidence.</p>
      </example>

      <p>When an estimate of the proportion is available, we use it in place of the worst case proportion value, 0.5.</p>
      <p>\footnotetext{For a 90 percent confidence interval, <m>z^{\star} = 1.6449</m>, and since an estimate of the proportion 0.017 is available, we'll use it in the margin of error formula:</p>
      <me>1.6449\times \sqrt{\frac{0.017(1-0.017)}{n}} &\ < \ 0.01 \qquad\to\qquad \frac{0.017(1-0.017)}{n} \ < \ \left(\frac{0.01}{1.6449}\right)^2 \qquad\to\qquad 452.15 \ < \ n</me>
      <p>For sample size calculations, we always round up, so the first tire model suggests 453 tires would be sufficient.</p>
      <p>A similar computation can be accomplished using 0.062 and 0.013 for <m>p</m>, and you should verify that using these proportions results in minimum sample sizes of 1574 and 348 tires, respectively.}</p>
      <example xml:id="">
        <p>Guided Practice <xref ref="tire_failure_rate_3_samp_size_calc"/>. Which of the three would you suggest using? What would influence your choice?} We could examine which of the old models is most like the new model, then choose the corresponding sample size. Or if two of the previous estimates are based on small samples while the other is based on a larger sample, we might consider the value corresponding to the larger sample. There are also other reasonable approaches.</p>
        <p>Also observe that the success-failure condition would need to be checked in the final sample. For instance, if we sampled <m>n = 1584</m> tires and found a failure rate of 0.5 percent, the normal approximation would not be reasonable, and we would require more advanced statistical methods for creating the confidence interval.</p>
      </example>

      <p>\footnotetext{We complete the same computations as before, except now we use <m>0.70</m> instead of <m>0.5</m> for <m>p</m>:</p>
      <me>1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \approx 1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{\paydayRegProp{}(1-\paydayRegProp{})} {n}} &\leq 0.05 \qquad\to\qquad n \geq 322.7</me>
      <p>A sample size of 323 or more would be reasonable. (Reminder: always round up for sample size calculations!) Given that we plan to track this poll over time, we also may want to periodically repeat these calculations to ensure that we're being thoughtful in our sample size recommendations in case the baseline rate fluctuates.}</p>

    <title>Difference of two proportions</title>

    <p>We would like to extend the methods from <xref ref="singleProportion"/> to apply confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to differences in population proportions: <m>p_1 - p_2</m>. In our investigations, we'll identify a reasonable point estimate of <m>p_1 - p_2</m> based on the sample, and you may have already guessed its form: <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m>. % Next, we'll apply the same processes we used in the single-proportion context: we verify that the point estimate can be modeled using a normal distribution, we compute the estimate's standard error, and we apply our inferential framework.</p>

      <p>of two proportions}</p>
      <p>Like with <m>\hat{p}</m>, the difference of two sample proportions <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m> can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met. First, we require a broader independence condition, and secondly, the success-failure condition must be met by both groups.</p>
      <assemblage>
        <p>sampling distribution of $\pmb{\hat{\MakeLowercase{p}}_1 - \hat{\MakeLowercase{p}}_2}$ to be normal} The difference <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m> can be modeled using a normal distribution when</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><em>Independence, extended.</em> The data are independent within and between the two groups. Generally this is satisfied if the data come from two independent random samples or if the data come from a randomized experiment.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>Success-failure condition.</em> The success-failure condition holds for both groups, where we check successes and failures in each group separately.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When these conditions are satisfied, the standard error of <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m> is  \begin{eqnarray*} SE %_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}  \end{eqnarray*} where <m>p_1</m> and <m>p_2</m> represent the population proportions, and <m>n_1</m> and <m>n_2</m> represent the sample sizes.</p>

      <p>We can also follow the same Prepare, Check, Calculate, Conclude steps for computing a confidence interval or completing a hypothesis test. The details change a little, but the general approach remain the same. Think about these steps when you apply statistical methods.</p>
      <example xml:id="">
        <p>who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. These patients were randomly divided into a treatment group where they received a blood thinner or the control group where they did not receive a blood thinner. The outcome variable of interest was whether the patients survived for at least 24 hours. The results are shown in <xref ref="resultsForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSection"/>. Check whether we can model the difference in sample proportions using the normal distribution.}</p>
        <p>We first check for independence: since this is a randomized experiment, this condition is satisfied.</p>
        <p>Next, we check the success-failure condition for each group. We have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each experiment arm (11, 14, 39, 26), so this condition is also satisfied.</p>
        <p>With both conditions satisfied, the difference in sample proportions can be reasonably modeled using a normal distribution for these data.</p>

        <me>\hat{p}_{t} - \hat{p}_{c} = \frac{14}{40} - \frac{11}{50} = 0.35 - 0.22 = 0.13</me>
        <p>We use the standard error formula provided on page \pageref{seForDiffOfProp}. As with the one-sample proportion case, we use the sample estimates of each proportion in the formula in the confidence interval context:</p>

      <p>\subsection%[Hypothesis tests for <m>p_1 - p_2</m>] {Hypothesis tests for the difference of two proportions}</p>
      <p>A mammogram is an X-ray procedure used to check for breast cancer. Whether mammograms should be used is part of a controversial discussion, and it's the topic of our next example where we learn about 2-proportion hypothesis tests when <m>H_0</m> is <m>p_1 - p_2 = 0</m> (or equivalently, <m>p_1 = p_2</m>).</p>
      <p>A 30-year study was conducted with nearly 90,000 female participants. During a 5-year screening period, each woman was randomized to one of two groups: in the first group, women received regular mammograms to screen for breast cancer, and in the second group, women received regular non-mammogram breast cancer exams. No intervention was made during the following 25 years of the study, and we'll consider death resulting from breast cancer over the full 30-year period. Results from the study are summarized in <xref ref="mammogramStudySummaryTable"/>.</p>
      <p>If mammograms are much more effective than non-mammogram breast cancer exams, then we would expect to see additional deaths from breast cancer in the control group. On the other hand, if mammograms are not as effective as regular breast cancer exams, we would expect to see an increase in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram group.</p>
      <figure xml:id="mammogramStudySummaryTable">
        <caption>Summary results for breast cancer study.</caption>
      </figure>

      <p>\footnotetext{This is an experiment. Patients were randomized to receive mammograms or a standard breast cancer exam. We will be able to make causal conclusions based on this study.}</p>
      <p>\footnotetext{<m>H_0</m>: the breast cancer death rate for patients screened using mammograms is the same as the breast cancer death rate for patients in the control, <m>p_{mgm} - p_{ctrl} = 0</m>. \\ <m>H_A</m>: the breast cancer death rate for patients screened using mammograms is different than the breast cancer death rate for patients in the control, <m>p_{mgm} - p_{ctrl} \neq 0</m>.}</p>
      <p>In <xref ref="condFormammogramStudySummaryTableNormalInference"/>, we will check the conditions for using a normal distribution to analyze the results of the study. The details are very similar to that of confidence intervals. However, when the null hypothesis is that <m>p_1 - p_2 = 0</m>, we use a special proportion called the <term>pooled proportion</term> to check the success-failure condition:</p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\hat{p}_{\textit{pooled}} &= \frac {\text{\# of patients who died from breast cancer in the entire study}} {\text{\# of patients in the entire study}}</mrow>

        <mrow>&= 0.0112</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>This proportion is an estimate of the breast cancer death rate across the entire study, and it's our best estimate of the proportions <m>p_{mgm}</m> and <m>p_{ctrl}</m> <em>if the null hypothesis is true that <m>p_{mgm} = p_{ctrl}</m></em>. We will also use this pooled proportion when computing the standard error.</p>
      <example xml:id="">
        <p>in proportions using a normal distribution in this study?} % Because the patients are randomized, they can be treated as independent, both within and between groups. We also must check the success-failure condition for each group. Under the null hypothesis, the proportions <m>p_{mgm}</m> and <m>p_{ctrl}</m> are equal, so we check the success-failure condition with our best estimate of these values under <m>H_0</m>, the <term>pooled proportion</term> from the two samples, <m>\hat{p}_{\textit{pooled}} = 0.0112</m>:</p>

      </example>

      <p>Can we conclude that mammograms have no benefits or harm? Here are a few considerations to keep in mind when reviewing the mammogram study as well as any other medical study:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>We do not reject the null hypothesis, which means we don't have sufficient evidence to conclude that mammograms reduce or increase breast cancer deaths.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If mammograms are helpful or harmful, the data suggest the effect isn't very large.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Are mammograms more or less expensive than a non-mammogram breast exam? If one option is much more expensive than the other and doesn't offer clear benefits, then we should lean towards the less expensive option.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The study's authors also found that mammograms led to overdiagnosis of breast cancer, which means some breast cancers were found (or thought to be found) but that these cancers would not cause symptoms during patients' lifetimes. That is, something else would kill the patient before breast cancer symptoms appeared. This means some patients may have been treated for breast cancer unnecessarily, and this treatment is another cost to consider. It is also important to recognize that overdiagnosis can cause unnecessary physical or emotional harm to patients.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These considerations highlight the complexity around medical care and treatment recommendations. Experts and medical boards who study medical treatments use considerations like those above to provide their best recommendation based on the current evidence.</p>

      <p>When we conduct a 2-proportion hypothesis test, usually <m>H_0</m> is <m>p_1 - p_2 = 0</m>. However, there are rare situations where we want to check for some difference in <m>p_1</m> and <m>p_2</m> that is some value other than 0.

        <p>Guided Practice <xref ref="carWheelBladeManufacturer"/> collects a sample of blades, examining 1000 blades from each company, and she finds that 899 blades pass inspection from the current supplier and 958 pass inspection from the prospective supplier. Using these data, evaluate the hypotheses from Guided Practice <xref ref="carWheelBladeManufacturer"/> with a significance level of 5 percent.} % First, we check the conditions. The sample is not necessarily random, so to proceed we must assume the blades are all independent; for this sample we will suppose this assumption is reasonable, but the engineer would be more knowledgeable as to whether this assumption is appropriate. The success-failure condition also holds for each sample. Thus, the difference in sample proportions, <m>0.958 - 0.899 = 0.059</m>, can be said to come from a nearly normal distribution.</p>
        <p>The standard error is computed using the two sample proportions since we do not use a pooled proportion for this context:</p>
        <me>SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.958(1-0.958)}{1000} + \frac{0.899(1-0.899)}{1000}} = 0.0114</me>
        <p>In this hypothesis test, because the null is that <m>p_1 - p_2 = 0.03</m>, the sample proportions were used for the standard error calculation rather than a pooled proportion.</p>

        <p>Using a standard normal distribution for this test statistic, we identify the right tail area as 0.006, and we double it to get the p-value: 0.012. We reject the null hypothesis because 0.012 is less than 0.05. Since we observed a larger-than-3 percent increase in blades that pass inspection, we have statistically significant evidence that the higher-quality blades pass inspection <em>more than</em> 3 percent as often as the currently used blades, exceeding the company's claims.</p>

      <p>(special topic)}</p>
      <p>This subsection covers more theoretical topics that offer deeper insights into the origins of the standard error formula for the difference of two proportions. Ultimately, all of the standard error formulas we encounter in this chapter and in <xref ref="ch_inference_for_means"/> can be derived from the probability principles of <xref ref="randomVariablesSection"/>.</p>
      <p>The formula for the standard error of the difference in two proportions can be deconstructed into the formulas for the standard errors of the individual sample proportions. Recall that the standard error of the individual sample proportions <m>\hat{p}_1</m> and <m>\hat{p}_2</m> are</p>
      <me>&SE_{\hat{p}_1} = \sqrt{\frac{{p}_1 (1 - {p}_1)}{n_1}} &&SE_{\hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{{p}_2 (1 - {p}_2)}{n_2}}</me>
      <p>The standard error of the difference of two sample proportions can be deconstructed from the standard errors of the separate sample proportions:</p>
      <me>SE_{\hat{p}_{1} - \hat{p}_{2}} = \sqrt{SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2} = \sqrt{\frac{{p}_1 (1 - {p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{{p}_2 (1 - {p}_2)}{n_2}}</me>
      <p>This special relationship follows from probability theory.</p>
      <p>\footnotetext{The standard error squared represents the variance of the estimate. If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are two random variables with variances <m>\sigma_x^2</m> and <m>\sigma_y^2</m>, then the variance of <m>X - Y</m> is <m>\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2</m>. Likewise, the variance corresponding to <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m> is <m>\sigma_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + \sigma_{\hat{p}_2}^2</m>. Because <m>\sigma_{\hat{p}_1}^2</m> and <m>\sigma_{\hat{p}_2}^2</m> are just another way of writing <m>SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2</m> and <m>SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2</m>, the variance associated with <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m> may be written as <m>SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2</m>.}</p>

  <section xml:id="oneWayChiSquare">
    <title>Testing for goodness of fit using chi-square</title>

    <p>In this section, we develop a method for assessing a null model when the data are binned. This technique is commonly used in two circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Given a sample of cases that can be classified into several groups, determine if the sample is representative of the general population.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Evaluate whether data resemble a particular distribution, such as a normal distribution or a geometric distribution.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these scenarios can be addressed using the same statistical test: a chi-square test.</p>
    <p>In the first case, we consider data from a random sample of 275 jurors in a small county. Jurors identified their racial group, as shown in <xref ref="juryRepresentationAndCityRepresentationForRace"/>, and we would like to determine if these jurors are racially representative of the population. If the jury is representative of the population, then the proportions in the sample should roughly reflect the population of eligible jurors, i.e. registered voters.</p>
    <figure xml:id="juryRepresentationAndCityRepresentationForRace">
      <caption>Representation by race in a city's juries and population.</caption>
    </figure>

    <p>While the proportions in the juries do not precisely represent the population proportions, it is unclear whether these data provide convincing evidence that the sample is not representative. If the jurors really were randomly sampled from the registered voters, we might expect small differences due to chance. However, unusually large differences may provide convincing evidence that the juries were not representative.</p>
    <p>A second application, assessing the fit of a distribution, is presented at the end of this section. Daily stock returns from the S&amp;P500 for 25 years are used to assess whether stock activity each day is independent of the stock's behavior on previous days.</p>
    <p>In these problems, we would like to examine all bins simultaneously, not simply compare one or two bins at a time, which will require us to develop a new test statistic.</p>
    <subsection xml:id="">
      <title>Creating a test statistic for one-way tables</title>
      <example xml:id="">
        <title>Of the people in the city, 275 served on a jury. If the individuals are randomly selected to serve on a jury, about how many of the 275 people would we expect to be White? How many would we expect to be Black?</title>
        <p>About 72 percent of the population is White, so we would expect about 72 percent of the jurors to be White: <m>0.72\times 275 = 198</m>.</p>
        <p>Similarly, we would expect about 7 percent of the jurors to be Black, which would correspond to about <m>0.07\times 275 = 19.25</m> Black jurors.</p>
      </example>

      <figure xml:id="expectedJuryRepresentationIfNoBias">
        <caption>Actual and expected make-up of the jurors.</caption>
      </figure>

      <p>The sample proportion represented from each race among the 275 jurors was not a precise match for any ethnic group. While some sampling variation is expected, we would expect the sample proportions to be fairly similar to the population proportions if there is no bias on juries. We need to test whether the differences are strong enough to provide convincing evidence that the jurors are not a random sample. These ideas can be organized into hypotheses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>[<m>H_0</m>:] The jurors are a random sample, i.e. there is no racial bias in who serves on a jury, and the observed counts reflect natural sampling fluctuation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>[<m>H_A</m>:] The jurors are not randomly sampled, i.e. there is racial bias in juror selection.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To evaluate these hypotheses, we quantify how different the observed counts are from the expected counts. Strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis would come in the form of unusually large deviations in the groups from what would be expected based on sampling variation alone.</p>
  </subsection>

    <subsection xml:id="chiSquareTestStatistic">
      <title>The chi-square test statistic</title>
      <p>In previous hypothesis tests, we constructed a test statistic of the following form:</p>
      <me>\frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}} {\text{SE of point estimate}}</me>
      <p>This construction was based on (1) identifying the difference between a point estimate and an expected value if the null hypothesis was true, and (2) standardizing that difference using the standard error of the point estimate. These two ideas will help in the construction of an appropriate test statistic for count data.</p>
      <p>Our strategy will be to first compute the difference between the observed counts and the counts we would expect if the null hypothesis was true, then we will standardize the difference:</p>
      <me>Z_{1} = \frac{\text{observed White count} - \text{null White count}} {\text{SE of observed White count}}</me>
      <p>The standard error for the point estimate of the count in binned data is the square root of the count under the null.<fn>Using some of the rules learned in earlier chapters, we might think that the standard error would be <m>np(1-p)</m>, where <m>n</m> is the sample size and <m>p</m> is the proportion in the population. This would be correct if we were looking only at one count. However, we are computing many standardized differences and adding them together. It can be shown – though not here – that the square root of the count is a better way to standardize the count differences.</fn> Therefore:</p>
      <me>Z_1 = \frac{205 - 198}{\sqrt{198}} = 0.50</me>
      <p>The fraction is very similar to previous test statistics: first compute a difference, then standardize it. These computations should also be completed for the Black, Hispanic, and other groups:</p>
      <md>
        <mrow>&Black && Hispanic	&&Other</mrow>
        <mrow>& Z_2 = \frac{26-19.25}{\sqrt{19.25}}=1.54\ \ \ \ && Z_3 = \frac{25-33}{\sqrt{33}}=-1.39\ \ \ \ && Z_4 = \frac{19-24.75}{\sqrt{24.75}}=-1.16</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>We would like to use a single test statistic to determine if these four standardized differences are irregularly far from zero. That is, <m>Z_1</m>, <m>Z_2</m>, <m>Z_3</m>, and <m>Z_4</m> must be combined somehow to help determine if they – as a group – tend to be unusually far from zero. A first thought might be to take the absolute value of these four standardized differences and add them up:</p>
      <me>|Z_1| + |Z_2| + |Z_3| + |Z_4| = 4.58</me>
      <p>Indeed, this does give one number summarizing how far the actual counts are from what was expected. However, it is more common to add the squared values:</p>
      <me>Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + Z_3^2 + Z_4^2 = 5.89</me>
      <p>Squaring each standardized difference before adding them together does two things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Any standardized difference that is squared will now be positive.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Differences that already look unusual – e.g. a standardized difference of 2.5 – will become much larger after being squared.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The test statistic <m>X^2</m>, which is the sum of the <m>Z^2</m> values, is generally used for these reasons. We can also write an equation for <m>X^2</m> using the observed counts and null counts:</p>
      <me>X^2 &= \frac {\text{\footnotesize$(\text{observed count}_1 - \text{null count}_1)^2$}} {\text{\footnotesize$\text{null count}_1$}} + \dots + \frac {\text{\footnotesize$(\text{observed count}_4 - \text{null count}_4)^2$}} {\text{\footnotesize$\text{null count}_4$}}</me>
      <p>The final number <m>X^2</m> summarizes how strongly the observed counts tend to deviate from the null counts. In <xref ref="pValueForAChiSquareTest"/>, we will see that if the null hypothesis is true, then <m>X^2</m> follows a new distribution called a <em>chi-square distribution</em>. Using this distribution, we will be able to obtain a p-value to evaluate the hypotheses.</p>

      <title>The chi-square distribution and finding areas</title>
      <p>The <term>chi-square distribution</term> is sometimes used to characterize data sets and statistics that are always positive and typically right skewed. Recall a normal distribution had two parameters – mean and standard deviation – that could be used to describe its exact characteristics.

      <p>\footnotetext{(a) The center becomes larger. If took a careful look, we could see that the mean of each distribution is equal to the distribution's degrees of freedom. (b) The variability increases as the degrees of freedom increases. (c) The distribution is very strongly skewed for <m>df=2</m>, and then the distributions become more symmetric for the larger degrees of freedom <m>df=4</m> and <m>df=9</m>.

      <p>Our principal interest in the chi-square distribution is the calculation of p-values, which (as we have seen before) is related to finding the relevant area in the tail of a distribution. The most common ways to do this are using computer software, using a graphing calculator, or using a table. For folks wanting to use the table option, we provide an outline of how to read the chi-square table in Appendix <xref ref="chiSquareProbabilityTable"/>, which is also where you may find the table. For the examples below, use your preferred approach to confirm you get the same answers.</p>
      <example xml:id="">
        <title>Figure \ref{chiSquareAreaAbove6Point25WithDF3</title>
        <p>shows a chi-square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom and an upper shaded tail starting at 6.25. Find the shaded area.} Using statistical software or a graphing calculator, we can find that the upper tail area for a chi-square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom (<m>df</m>) and a cutoff of 6.25 is 0.1001. That is, the shaded upper tail of <xref ref="chiSquareAreaAbove6Point25WithDF3"/> has area 0.1.</p>

      <title>Finding a p-value for a chi-square distribution</title>
      <p>In <xref ref="chiSquareTestStatistic"/>, we identified a new test statistic (<m>X^2</m>) within the context of assessing whether there was evidence of racial bias in how jurors were sampled. The null hypothesis represented the claim that jurors were randomly sampled and there was no racial bias. The alternative hypothesis was that there was racial bias in how the jurors were sampled.</p>
      <p>We determined that a large <m>X^2</m> value would suggest strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis: that there was racial bias. However, we could not quantify what the chance was of observing such a large test statistic (<m>X^2=5.89</m>) if the null hypothesis actually was true. This is where the chi-square distribution becomes useful. If the null hypothesis was true and there was no racial bias, then <m>X^2</m> would follow a chi-square distribution, with three degrees of freedom in this case. Under certain conditions, the statistic <m>X^2</m> follows a chi-square distribution with <m>k - 1</m> degrees of freedom, where <m>k</m> is the number of bins.</p>
      <example xml:id="">
        <title>How many categories were there in the juror example? How many degrees of freedom should be associated with the chi-square distribution used for <m>X^2</m>?</title>
        <p>In the jurors example, there were <m>k=4</m> categories: White, Black, Hispanic, and other. According to the rule above, the test statistic <m>X^2</m> should then follow a chi-square distribution with <m>k-1 = 3</m> degrees of freedom if <m>H_0</m> is true.</p>
      </example>

      <p>Just like we checked sample size conditions to use a normal distribution in earlier sections, we must also check a sample size condition to safely apply the chi-square distribution for <m>X^2</m>. Each expected count must be at least 5. In the juror example, the expected counts were 198, 19.25, 33, and 24.75, all easily above 5, so we can apply the chi-square model to the test statistic, <m>X^2=5.89</m>.</p>
      <example xml:id="">
        <p>the test statistic <m>X^2=5.89</m> would be closely associated with a chi-square distribution with three degrees of freedom. Using this distribution and test statistic, identify the p-value.} The chi-square distribution and p-value are shown in <xref ref="jurorHTPValueShown"/>. Because larger chi-square values correspond to stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, we shade the upper tail to represent the p-value. Using statistical software (or the table in Appendix <xref ref="chiSquareProbabilityTable"/>), we can determine that the area is 0.1171. Generally we do not reject the null hypothesis with such a large p-value. In other words, the data do not provide convincing evidence of racial bias in the juror selection.</p>

Call the <em>expected counts</em> that are based on the null hypothesis <m>E_1</m>, <m>E_2</m>, ..., <m>E_k</m>. If each expected count is at least 5 and the null hypothesis is true, then the test statistic below follows a chi-square distribution with <m>k-1</m> degrees of freedom:</p>
        <me>X^2 = \frac{(O_1 - E_1)^2}{E_1} + \frac{(O_2 - E_2)^2}{E_2} + \cdots + \frac{(O_k - E_k)^2}{E_k}</me>
        <p>The p-value for this test statistic is found by looking at the upper tail of this chi-square distribution. We consider the upper tail because larger values of <m>X^2</m> would provide greater evidence against the null hypothesis.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="">
      <title>Evaluating goodness of fit for a distribution</title>
      <p>We can apply the chi-square testing framework to the second problem in this section: evaluating whether a certain statistical model fits a data set. Daily stock returns from the S&amp;P500 for 10 can be used to assess whether stock activity each day is independent of the stock's behavior on previous days. This sounds like a very complex question, and it is, but a chi-square test can be used to study the problem. We will label each day as "Up" or "Down" ("D") depending on whether the market was up or down that day. For example, consider the following changes in price, their new labels of up and down, and then the number of days that must be observed before each "Up" day: \begin{center}\footnotesize \begin{tabular}{lc ccc ccc ccc cc} Change in price & & \footnotesize2.52 & \footnotesize-1.46 & \footnotesize 0.51 & \footnotesize-4.07 & \footnotesize3.36 & \footnotesize1.10 & \footnotesize-5.46 & \footnotesize-1.03 & \footnotesize-2.99 & \footnotesize1.71 \\ Outcome & & Up & D & Up & D & Up & Up & D & D & D & Up \\ \footnotesize Days to Up & & 1 & - & 2 & - & 2 & 1 & - & - & - & 4 \\ \end{tabular} \end{center} If the days really are independent, then the number of days until a positive trading day should follow a geometric distribution. The geometric distribution describes the probability of waiting for the <m>k^{th}</m> trial to observe the first success. Here each up day (Up) represents a success, and down (D) days represent failures. In the data above, it took only one day until the market was up, so the first wait time was 1 day. It took two more days before we observed our next "Up" trading day, and two more for the third "Up" day. We would like to determine if these counts (1, 2, 2, 1, 4, and so on) follow the geometric distribution. <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade"/> shows the number of waiting days for a positive trading day during 10 years for the S&amp;P500.</p>
      <figure xml:id="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade">
      </figure>

      <p>We consider how many days one must wait until observing an "Up" day on the S&amp;P500 stock index. If the stock activity was independent from one day to the next and the probability of a positive trading day was constant, then we would expect this waiting time to follow a <em>geometric distribution</em>. We can organize this into a hypothesis framework:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>[<m>H_0</m>:] The stock market being up or down on a given day is independent from all other days. We will consider the number of days that pass until an "Up" day is observed. Under this hypothesis, the number of days until an "Up" day should follow a geometric distribution.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>[<m>H_A</m>:] The stock market being up or down on a given day is not independent from all other days. Since we know the number of days until an "Up" day would follow a geometric distribution under the null, we look for deviations from the geometric distribution, which would support the alternative hypothesis.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are important implications in our result for stock traders: if information from past trading days is useful in telling what will happen today, that information may provide an advantage over other traders.</p>
      <p>We consider data for the S&amp;P500 and summarize the waiting times in <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade2"/> and <xref ref="geomFitEvaluationForSP500"/>. The S&amp;P500 was positive on 54.5 percent of those days.</p>
      <figure xml:id="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade2">

      <figure xml:id="geomFitEvaluationForSP500">
        <caption>A side-by-side bar plot is shown for the variable "Wait Until Positive Day", where the two groups shown for the bars are "Observed counts" and "Expected counts". The horizontal axis shows values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and "7+". The bar heights highest for "1" at roughly 715 for Observed and 740 for Expected. The bar heights for "2" are about half as high as at "1", with values of about 370 for Observed and 340 for Expected. The bar heights for "3" are about another half has high at about 150 for each for observed and expected. The values at 5, 6, and 7+ are all relatively small, at or below about 30.</caption>
        <image source="ch_foundations_for_inf/figures/geomFitEvaluationForSP500"/>
      </figure>

      <p>Because applying the chi-square framework requires expected counts to be at least 5, we have <em>binned</em> together all the cases where the waiting time was at least 1362N{} days to ensure each expected count is well above this minimum. The actual data, shown in the <em>Observed</em> row in <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade2"/>, can be compared to the expected counts from the <em>Geometric Model</em> row. The method for computing expected counts is discussed in <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade2"/>. In general, the expected counts are determined by (1) identifying the null proportion associated with each bin, then (2) multiplying each null proportion by the total count to obtain the expected counts. That is, this strategy identifies what proportion of the total count we would expect to be in each bin.</p>
      <example xml:id="">
        <p>in the graph? Can you tell if these deviations are due to chance just by looking?} It is not obvious whether differences in the observed counts and the expected counts from the geometric distribution are significantly different. That is, it is not clear whether these deviations might be due to chance or whether they are so strong that the data provide convincing evidence against the null hypothesis. However, we can perform a chi-square test using the counts in <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade2"/>.</p>

Using software, we can find the p-value: 1362Pvalue{}. Ultimately, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the notion that the wait times follow a geometric distribution for the last 10 years of data for the S&amp;P500, i.e. we cannot reject the notion that trading days are independent.</p>

    <title>Testing for independence in two-way tables</title>

    <p>We all buy used products – cars, computers, textbooks, and so on – and we sometimes assume the sellers of those products will be forthright about any underlying problems with what they're selling. This is not something we should take for granted. Researchers recruited 219 participants in a study where they would sell a used iPod\footnote{For readers not as old as the authors, an iPod is basically an iPhone without any cellular service, assuming it was one of the later generations. Earlier generations were more basic.} that was known to have frozen twice in the past. The participants were incentivized to get as much money as they could for the iPod since they would receive a 5 percent cut of the sale on top of \$10 for participating. The researchers wanted to understand what types of questions would elicit the seller to disclose the freezing issue.</p>
    <p>Unbeknownst to the participants who were the sellers in the study, the buyers were collaborating with the researchers to evaluate the influence of different questions on the likelihood of getting the sellers to disclose the past issues with the iPod. The scripted buyers started with "Okay, I guess I'm supposed to go first. So you've had the iPod for 2 years ..." and ended with one of three questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>General: What can you tell me about it?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Positive Assumption: It doesn't have any problems, does it?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Negative Assumption: What problems does it have?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The question is the treatment given to the sellers, and the response is whether the question prompted them to disclose the freezing issue with the iPod. The results are shown in <xref ref="ipod_ask_data_summary"/>, and the data suggest that asking the, <em>What problems does it have?</em>, was the most effective at getting the seller to disclose the past freezing issues. However, you should also be asking yourself: could we see these results due to chance alone, or is this in fact evidence that some questions are more effective for getting at the truth?</p>
    <figure xml:id="ipod_ask_data_summary">
    </figure>

    <assemblage>
      <title>Differences of one-way tables vs two-way tables</title>
      <p>A one-way table describes counts for each outcome in a single variable. A two-way table describes counts for <em>combinations</em> of outcomes for two variables. When we consider a two-way table, we often would like to know, are these variables related in any way? That is, are they dependent (versus independent)?</p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>The hypothesis test for the iPod experiment is really about assessing whether there is statistically significant evidence that the success each question had on getting the participant to disclose the problem with the iPod. In other words, the goal is to check whether the buyer's question was independent of whether the seller disclosed a problem.</p>
    <subsection xml:id="">
      <title>Expected counts in two-way tables</title>
      <example xml:id="">
        <p>we can compute the proportion of all sellers who disclosed the freezing problem as <m>61/219 = 0.2785</m>. If there really is no difference among the questions and 27.85 percent of sellers were going to disclose the freezing problem no matter the question that was put to them, how many of the 73 people in the "General" group would we have expected to disclose the freezing problem?} We would predict that <m>0.2785 \times 73 = 20.33</m> sellers would disclose the problem. Obviously we observed fewer than this, though it is not yet clear if that is due to chance variation or whether that is because the questions vary in how effective they are at getting to the truth.</p>
      </example>

      <p>\footnotetext{We would expect <m>(1 - 0.2785) \times 73 = 52.67</m>. It is okay that this result, like the result from <xref ref="iPodExComputeExpAA"/>, is a fraction.}</p>
      <p>We can compute the expected number of sellers who we would expect to disclose or hide the freezing issue for all groups, if the questions had no impact on what they disclosed, using the same strategy employed in <xref ref="iPodExComputeExpAA"/> and Guided Practice <xref ref="iPodExComputeExpBB"/>. These expected counts were used to construct <xref ref="ipod_ask_data_summary_expected"/>, which is the same as <xref ref="ipod_ask_data_summary"/>, except now the expected counts have been added in parentheses.</p>
      <figure xml:id="ipod_ask_data_summary_expected">
      </figure>

      <p>The examples and exercises above provided some help in computing expected counts. In general, expected counts for a two-way table may be computed using the row totals, column totals, and the table total. For instance, if there was no difference between the groups, then about 27.85 percent of each column should be in the first row:</p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\iPodAFraction{}\times (\text{column 1 total}) &= \iPodAExpected{}</mrow>
        <mrow>\iPodAFraction{}\times (\text{column 2 total}) &= \iPodAExpected{}</mrow>
        <mrow>\iPodAFraction{}\times (\text{column 3 total}) &= \iPodAExpected{}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>Looking back to how 0.2785 was computed – as the fraction of sellers who disclosed the freezing issue (<m>158/219</m>) – these three expected counts could have been computed as</p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\left(\frac{\text{row 1 total}}{\text{table total}}\right) \text{(column 1 total)} &= \iPodAExpected{}</mrow>
        <mrow>\left(\frac{\text{row 1 total}}{\text{table total}}\right) \text{(column 2 total)} &= \iPodAExpected{}</mrow>
        <mrow>\left(\frac{\text{row 1 total}}{\text{table total}}\right) \text{(column 3 total)} &= \iPodAExpected{}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>This leads us to a general formula for computing expected counts in a two-way table when we would like to test whether there is strong evidence of an association between the column variable and row variable.</p>

        <p>about whether the question affects the sellers likelihood of reporting the freezing problem.} Using a computer, we can compute a very precise value for the tail area above <m>X^2 = 40.13</m> for a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom: 0.000000002. (If using the table in Appendix <xref ref="chiSquareProbabilityTable"/>, we would identify the p-value is smaller than 0.001.) Using a significance level of <m>\alpha=0.05</m>, the null hypothesis is rejected since the p-value is smaller. That is, the data provide convincing evidence that the question asked did affect a seller's likelihood to tell the truth about problems with the iPod.</p>

        <p>summarizes the results of an experiment evaluating three treatments for Type 2 Diabetes in patients aged 10-17 who were being treated with metformin. The three treatments considered were continued treatment with metformin ("met"), treatment with metformin combined with rosiglitazone ("rosi"), or a lifestyle intervention program. Each patient had a primary outcome, which was either lacked glycemic control (failure) or did not lack that control (success). What are appropriate hypotheses for this test?}</p>

      <p>\footnotetext{The expected count for row one / column one is found by multiplying the row one total (234) and column one total (319), then dividing by the table total (699): <m>\frac{234\times 319}{699} = 106.8</m>. Similarly for the second column and the first row: <m>\frac{234\times 380}{699} = 127.2</m>. Row 2: 105.9 and 126.1. Row 3: 106.3 and 126.7.}</p>
      <p>\footnotetext{For each cell, compute <m>\frac{(\text{obs} - \text{exp})^2}{exp}</m>. For instance, the first row and first column: <m>\frac{(109-106.8)^2}{106.8} = 0.05</m>. Adding the results of each cell gives the chi-square test statistic: {\scriptsize<m>X^2 = 0.05 + \cdots + 2.11 = 8.16</m>}.}</p>
      <p>\footnotetext{ If using a computer, we can identify the p-value as 0.017. That is, we reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is less than 0.05, and we conclude that at least one of the treatments is more or less effective than the others at treating Type 2 Diabetes for glycemic control.}</p>
