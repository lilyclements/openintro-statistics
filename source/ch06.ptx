  <title>Inference for Categorical Data</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we apply the methods and ideas from Chapter 5 in several contexts for
      categorical data. We'll start by revisiting what we learned for a single proportion, where
      the normal distribution can be used to model the uncertainty in the sample proportion. Next,
      we apply these same ideas to analyze the difference of two proportions using the normal model.
      Later in the chapter, we apply inference techniques to contingency tables; while we will use
      a different distribution in this context, the core ideas of hypothesis testing remain the same.

    <title>Inference for a single proportion</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        We encountered inference methods for a single proportion in Chapter<nbsp/>5, exploring point estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests. In this section, we'll do a review of these topics and also how to choose an appropriate sample size when collecting data for single proportion contexts.

      <title>Identifying when the sample proportion is nearly normal</title>
      
      <p>
        A sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> can be modeled using a normal distribution when the sample observations are independent and the sample size is sufficiently large.
      </p>
      
      <assemblage xml:id="assem-sampling-dist-p-hat">
        <title>Sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m></title>
        <p>
          The sampling distribution for <m>\hat{p}</m> based on a sample of size <m>n</m> from a population with a true proportion <m>p</m> is nearly normal when:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The sample's observations are independent, e.g. are from a simple random sample.</li>
          <li>We expected to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, i.e. <m>np \geq 10</m> and <m>n(1-p) \geq 10</m>. This is called the <term>success-failure condition</term>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          When these conditions are met, then the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> is nearly normal with mean <m>p</m> and standard error <m>SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}</m>.
        </p>
      </assemblage>
      
      <p>
        Typically we don't know the true proportion <m>p</m>, so we substitute some value to check conditions and estimate the standard error. For confidence intervals, the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> is used to check the success-failure condition and compute the standard error. For hypothesis tests, typically the null value<mdash/>that is, the proportion claimed in the null hypothesis<mdash/>is used in place of <m>p</m>.

      <title>Confidence intervals for a proportion</title>
      
      <p>
        A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the parameter <m>p</m>, and when <m>\hat{p}</m> can be modeled using a normal distribution, the confidence interval for <m>p</m> takes the form
      </p>

            A simple random sample of 826 payday loan borrowers was surveyed to better understand their interests around regulation and costs. 70% of the responses supported new regulations on payday lenders. Is it reasonable to model <m>\hat{p} = 0.70</m> using a normal distribution?

            The data are a random sample, so the observations are independent and representative of the population of interest.

          <p>
            We also must check the success-failure condition, which we do using <m>\hat{p}</m> in place of <m>p</m> when computing a confidence interval:

            Since both values are at least 10, we can use the normal distribution to model <m>\hat{p}</m>.

        To apply the normal distribution framework in the context of a hypothesis test for a proportion, the independence and success-failure conditions must be satisfied. In a hypothesis test, the success-failure condition is checked using the null proportion: we verify <m>np_0</m> and <m>n(1-p_0)</m> are at least 10, where <m>p_0</m> is the null value.

      <title>When one or more conditions aren't met</title>
      
      <p>
        We've spent a lot of time discussing conditions for when <m>\hat{p}</m> can be reasonably modeled by a normal distribution. What happens when the success-failure condition fails? What about when the independence condition fails? In either case, the general ideas of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests remain the same, but the strategy or technique used to generate the interval or p-value change.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the success-failure condition isn't met for a hypothesis test, we can simulate the null distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> using the null value, <m>p_0</m>. The simulation concept is similar to the ideas used in the malaria case study presented in Section<nbsp/>5.1, and an online section outlines this strategy: <url href="http://www.openintro.org/r?go=stat_sim_prop_ht">www.openintro.org/r?go=stat_sim_prop_ht</url>
      </p>
      <p>
        For a confidence interval when the success-failure condition isn't met, we can use what's called the <term>Clopper-Pearson interval</term>. The details are beyond the scope of this book. However, there are many internet resources covering this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The independence condition is a more nuanced requirement. When it isn't met, it is important to understand how and why it isn't met. For example, if we took a cluster sample (see Section<nbsp/>1.3), suitable statistical methods are available but would be beyond the scope of even most second or third courses in statistics. On the other hand, we'd be stretched to find any method that we could confidently apply to correct the inherent biases of data from a convenience sample.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this book is scoped to well-constrained statistical problems, do remember that this is just the first book in what is a large library of statistical methods that are suitable for a very wide range of data and contexts.

      <title>Choosing a sample size when estimating a proportion</title>
      
      <p>
        When collecting data, we choose a sample size suitable for the purpose of the study. Often times this means choosing a sample size large enough that the <term>margin of error</term><mdash/>which is the part we add and subtract from the point estimate in a confidence interval<mdash/>is sufficiently small that the sample is useful. For example, our task might be to find a sample size <m>n</m> so that the sample proportion is within <m>\pm 0.04</m> of the actual proportion in a 95% confidence interval.
      </p>
      
      <example xml:id="ex-football-stadium-sample-size">
        <statement>

            A university newspaper is conducting a survey to determine what fraction of students support a $200 per year increase in fees to pay for a new football stadium. How big of a sample is required to ensure the margin of error is smaller than 0.04 using a 95% confidence level?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The margin of error for a sample proportion is
          </p>
          <me>
            z^{\star} \sqrt{\frac{p (1 - p)}{n}}
          </me>
          <p>
            Our goal is to find the smallest sample size <m>n</m> so that this margin of error is smaller than 0.04. For a 95% confidence level, the value <m>z^{\star}</m> corresponds to 1.96:
          </p>

            1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \ \lt \ 0.04
          </me>
          <p>
            There are two unknowns in the equation: <m>p</m> and <m>n</m>. If we have an estimate of <m>p</m>, perhaps from a prior survey, we could enter in that value and solve for <m>n</m>. If we have no such estimate, we must use some other value for <m>p</m>. It turns out that the margin of error is largest when <m>p</m> is 0.5, so we typically use this <em>worst case value</em> if no estimate of the proportion is available:

          <p>
            We would need over 600.25 participants, which means we need 601 participants or more, to ensure the sample proportion is within 0.04 of the true proportion with 95% confidence.

The quality control team has monitored the last three tire models produced by the factory, failing 1.7% of tires in the first model, 6.2% of the second model, and 1.3% of the third model. The manager would like to examine enough tires to estimate the failure rate of the new tire model to within about 1% with a 90% confidence level. There are three different failure rates to choose from. Perform the sample size computation for each separately, and identify three sample sizes to consider.

            A similar computation can be accomplished using 0.062 and 0.013 for <m>p</m>, and you should verify that using these proportions results in minimum sample sizes of 1574 and 348 tires, respectively.

        Like with <m>\hat{p}</m>, the difference of two sample proportions <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m> can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met. First, we require a broader independence condition, and secondly, the success-failure condition must be met by both groups.

        We can apply the generic confidence interval formula for a difference of two proportions, where we use <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m> as the point estimate and substitute the <m>SE</m> formula:

        We can also follow the same Prepare, Check, Calculate, Conclude steps for computing a confidence interval or completing a hypothesis test. The details change a little, but the general approach remain the same. Think about these steps when you apply statistical methods.

          <p>
            We consider an experiment for patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. These patients were randomly divided into a treatment group where they received a blood thinner or the control group where they did not receive a blood thinner. The outcome variable of interest was whether the patients survived for at least 24 hours. The results are shown in <xref ref="resultsForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSection"/>. Check whether we can model the difference in sample proportions using the normal distribution.

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We first check for independence: since this is a randomized experiment, this condition is satisfied.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, we check the success-failure condition for each group. We have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each experiment arm (11, 14, 39, 26), so this condition is also satisfied.
          </p>
          <p>
            With both conditions satisfied, the difference in sample proportions can be reasonably modeled using a normal distribution for these data.

      <title>Hypothesis tests for the difference of two proportions</title>
      
      <p>
        A mammogram is an X-ray procedure used to check for breast cancer. Whether mammograms should be used is part of a controversial discussion, and it's the topic of our next example where we learn about 2-proportion hypothesis tests when <m>H_0</m> is <m>p_1 - p_2 = 0</m> (or equivalently, <m>p_1 = p_2</m>).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A 30-year study was conducted with nearly 90,000 female participants. During a 5-year screening period, each woman was randomized to one of two groups: in the first group, women received regular mammograms to screen for breast cancer, and in the second group, women received regular non-mammogram breast cancer exams. No intervention was made during the following 25 years of the study, and we'll consider death resulting from breast cancer over the full 30-year period. Results from the study are summarized in <xref ref="mammogramStudySummaryTable"/>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If mammograms are much more effective than non-mammogram breast cancer exams, then we would expect to see additional deaths from breast cancer in the control group. On the other hand, if mammograms are not as effective as regular breast cancer exams, we would expect to see an increase in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram group.

The details are very similar to that of confidence intervals. However, when the null hypothesis is that <m>p_1 - p_2 = 0</m>, we use a special proportion called the <term>pooled proportion</term> to check the success-failure condition:

        This proportion is an estimate of the breast cancer death rate across the entire study, and it's our best estimate of the proportions <m>p_{mgm}</m> and <m>p_{ctrl}</m> <em>if the null hypothesis is true that <m>p_{mgm} = p_{ctrl}</m></em>.

            The lower tail area is 0.4325, which we double to get the p-value: 0.8650. Because this p-value is larger than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, the difference in breast cancer death rates is reasonably explained by chance, and we do not observe benefits or harm from mammograms relative to a regular breast exam.

      <p>
        Can we conclude that mammograms have no benefits or harm? Here are a few considerations to keep in mind when reviewing the mammogram study as well as any other medical study:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We do not reject the null hypothesis, which means we don't have sufficient evidence to conclude that mammograms reduce or increase breast cancer deaths.
        </li>
        <li>
          If mammograms are helpful or harmful, the data suggest the effect isn't very large.
        </li>
        <li>
          Are mammograms more or less expensive than a non-mammogram breast exam? If one option is much more expensive than the other and doesn't offer clear benefits, then we should lean towards the less expensive option.
        </li>
        <li>
          The study's authors also found that mammograms led to overdiagnosis of breast cancer, which means some breast cancers were found (or thought to be found) but that these cancers would not cause symptoms during patients' lifetimes. That is, something else would kill the patient before breast cancer symptoms appeared. This means some patients may have been treated for breast cancer unnecessarily, and this treatment is another cost to consider. It is also important to recognize that overdiagnosis can cause unnecessary physical or emotional harm to patients.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These considerations highlight the complexity around medical care and treatment recommendations. Experts and medical boards who study medical treatments use considerations like those above to provide their best recommendation based on the current evidence.

      <p>
        When we conduct a 2-proportion hypothesis test, usually <m>H_0</m> is <m>p_1 - p_2 = 0</m>. However, there are rare situations where we want to check for some difference in <m>p_1</m> and <m>p_2</m> that is some value other than 0. For example, maybe we care about checking a null hypothesis where <m>p_1 - p_2 = 0.1</m>. In contexts like these, we generally use <m>\hat{p}_1</m> and <m>\hat{p}_2</m> to check the success-failure condition and construct the standard error.

        <statement>
          <p>
            The quality control engineer from Guided Practice<nbsp/><xref ref="carWheelBladeManufacturer"/> collects a sample of blades, examining 1000 blades from each company, and she finds that 899 blades pass inspection from the current supplier and 958 pass inspection from the prospective supplier. Using these data, evaluate the hypotheses from Guided Practice<nbsp/><xref ref="carWheelBladeManufacturer"/> with a significance level of 5%.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            First, we check the conditions. The sample is not necessarily random, so to proceed we must assume the blades are all independent; for this sample we will suppose this assumption is reasonable, but the engineer would be more knowledgeable as to whether this assumption is appropriate. The success-failure condition also holds for each sample. Thus, the difference in sample proportions, <m>0.958 - 0.899 = 0.059</m>, can be said to come from a nearly normal distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The standard error is computed using the two sample proportions since we do not use a pooled proportion for this context:
          </p>
          <md>
            <mrow>SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.958(1-0.958)}{1000} + \frac{0.899(1-0.899)}{1000}} = 0.0114</mrow>
          </md>
          <p>
            In this hypothesis test, because the null is that <m>p_1 - p_2 = 0.03</m>, the sample proportions were used for the standard error calculation rather than a pooled proportion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, we compute the test statistic and use it to find the p-value, which is depicted in <xref ref="bladesTwoSampleHTPValueQC"/>.
          </p>
          <md>
            <mrow>Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE} = \frac{0.059 - 0.03}{0.0114} = 2.54</mrow>
          </md>
          <p>
            Using a standard normal distribution for this test statistic, we identify the right tail area as 0.006, and we double it to get the p-value: 0.012. We reject the null hypothesis because 0.012 is less than 0.05. Since we observed a larger-than-3% increase in blades that pass inspection, we have statistically significant evidence that the higher-quality blades pass inspection <em>more than</em> 3% as often as the currently used blades, exceeding the company's claims.

        This subsection covers more theoretical topics that offer deeper insights into the origins of the standard error formula for the difference of two proportions. Ultimately, all of the standard error formulas we encounter in this chapter and in Chapter<nbsp/><xref ref="ch_inference_for_means"/> can be derived from the probability principles of Section<nbsp/><xref ref="randomVariablesSection"/>.

    <title>Testing for goodness of fit using chi-square</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this section, we develop a method for assessing a null model when the data are binned. This technique is commonly used in two circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Given a sample of cases that can be classified into several groups, determine if the sample is representative of the general population.</li>
        <li>Evaluate whether data resemble a particular distribution, such as a normal distribution or a geometric distribution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each of these scenarios can be addressed using the same statistical test: a chi-square test.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first case, we consider data from a random sample of 275 jurors in a small county. Jurors identified their racial group, as shown in <xref ref="juryRepresentationAndCityRepresentationForRace"/>, and we would like to determine if these jurors are racially representative of the population. If the jury is representative of the population, then the proportions in the sample should roughly reflect the population of eligible jurors, i.e. registered voters.

        While the proportions in the juries do not precisely represent the population proportions, it is unclear whether these data provide convincing evidence that the sample is not representative. If the jurors really were randomly sampled from the registered voters, we might expect small differences due to chance. However, unusually large differences may provide convincing evidence that the juries were not representative.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A second application, assessing the fit of a distribution, is presented at the end of this section. Daily stock returns from the S&amp;P500 for 25 years are used to assess whether stock activity each day is independent of the stock's behavior on previous days.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In these problems, we would like to examine all bins simultaneously, not simply compare one or two bins at a time, which will require us to develop a new test statistic.

        The sample proportion represented from each race among the 275 jurors was not a precise match for any ethnic group. While some sampling variation is expected, we would expect the sample proportions to be fairly similar to the population proportions if there is no bias on juries. We need to test whether the differences are strong enough to provide convincing evidence that the jurors are not a random sample. These ideas can be organized into hypotheses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><m>H_0</m>: The jurors are a random sample, i.e. there is no racial bias in who serves on a jury, and the observed counts reflect natural sampling fluctuation.</li>
        <li><m>H_A</m>: The jurors are not randomly sampled, i.e. there is racial bias in juror selection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To evaluate these hypotheses, we quantify how different the observed counts are from the expected counts. Strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis would come in the form of unusually large deviations in the groups from what would be expected based on sampling variation alone.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection xml:id="chiSquareTestStatistic">
      <title>The chi-square test statistic</title>
      
      <p>
        In previous hypothesis tests, we constructed a test statistic of the following form:
      </p>
      <me>
        \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{\text{SE of point estimate}}
      </me>
      <p>
        This construction was based on (1) identifying the difference between a point estimate and an expected value if the null hypothesis was true, and (2) standardizing that difference using the standard error of the point estimate. These two ideas will help in the construction of an appropriate test statistic for count data.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Our strategy will be to first compute the difference between the observed counts and the counts we would expect if the null hypothesis was true, then we will standardize the difference:
      </p>
      <me>
        Z_{1} = \frac{\text{observed White count} - \text{null White count}}{\text{SE of observed White count}}
      </me>
      <p>
        The standard error for the point estimate of the count in binned data is the square root of the count under the null.<fn>Using some of the rules learned in earlier chapters, we might think that the standard error would be <m>np(1-p)</m>, where <m>n</m> is the sample size and <m>p</m> is the proportion in the population. This would be correct if we were looking only at one count. However, we are computing many standardized differences and adding them together. It can be shown<mdash/>though not here<mdash/>that the square root of the count is a better way to standardize the count differences.</fn> Therefore:
      </p>
      <me>
        Z_1 = \frac{205 - 198}{\sqrt{198}} = 0.50
      </me>
      <p>
        The fraction is very similar to previous test statistics: first compute a difference, then standardize it. These computations should also be completed for the Black, Hispanic, and other groups:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{Black} \qquad Z_2 \amp = \frac{26-19.25}{\sqrt{19.25}}=1.54</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{Hispanic} \qquad Z_3 \amp = \frac{25-33}{\sqrt{33}}=-1.39</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{Other} \qquad Z_4 \amp = \frac{19-24.75}{\sqrt{24.75}}=-1.16</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        We would like to use a single test statistic to determine if these four standardized differences are irregularly far from zero. That is, <m>Z_1</m>, <m>Z_2</m>, <m>Z_3</m>, and <m>Z_4</m> must be combined somehow to help determine if they<mdash/>as a group<mdash/>tend to be unusually far from zero. A first thought might be to take the absolute value of these four standardized differences and add them up:
      </p>
      <me>
        |Z_1| + |Z_2| + |Z_3| + |Z_4| = 4.58
      </me>
      <p>
        Indeed, this does give one number summarizing how far the actual counts are from what was expected. However, it is more common to add the squared values:
      </p>
      <me>
        Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + Z_3^2 + Z_4^2 = 5.89
      </me>
      <p>
        Squaring each standardized difference before adding them together does two things:
      </p>

        <li>Any standardized difference that is squared will now be positive.</li>
        <li>Differences that already look unusual<mdash/>e.g. a standardized difference of 2.5<mdash/>will become much larger after being squared.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The test statistic <m>X^2</m>, which is the sum of the <m>Z^2</m> values, is generally used for these reasons. We can also write an equation for <m>X^2</m> using the observed counts and null counts:
      </p>
      <me>
        X^2 = \frac{(\text{observed count}_1 - \text{null count}_1)^2}{\text{null count}_1} + \dots + \frac{(\text{observed count}_4 - \text{null count}_4)^2}{\text{null count}_4}
      </me>
      <p>
        The final number <m>X^2</m> summarizes how strongly the observed counts tend to deviate from the null counts. In Section<nbsp/><xref ref="pValueForAChiSquareTest"/>, we will see that if the null hypothesis is true, then <m>X^2</m> follows a new distribution called a <em>chi-square distribution</em>. Using this distribution, we will be able to obtain a p-value to evaluate the hypotheses.

      <title>The chi-square distribution and finding areas</title>
      
      <p>
        The <term>chi-square distribution</term> is sometimes used to characterize data sets and statistics that are always positive and typically right skewed. Recall a normal distribution had two parameters<mdash/>mean and standard deviation<mdash/>that could be used to describe its exact characteristics. The chi-square distribution has just one parameter called <term>degrees of freedom (df)</term>, which influences the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.

        Our principal interest in the chi-square distribution is the calculation of p-values, which (as we have seen before) is related to finding the relevant area in the tail of a distribution. The most common ways to do this are using computer software, using a graphing calculator, or using a table. For folks wanting to use the table option, we provide an outline of how to read the chi-square table in Appendix<nbsp/>C, which is also where you may find the table. For the examples below, use your preferred approach to confirm you get the same answers.

      <title>Finding a p-value for a chi-square distribution</title>
      
      <p>
        In Section<nbsp/><xref ref="chiSquareTestStatistic"/>, we identified a new test statistic (<m>X^2</m>) within the context of assessing whether there was evidence of racial bias in how jurors were sampled. The null hypothesis represented the claim that jurors were randomly sampled and there was no racial bias. The alternative hypothesis was that there was racial bias in how the jurors were sampled.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We determined that a large <m>X^2</m> value would suggest strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis: that there was racial bias. However, we could not quantify what the chance was of observing such a large test statistic (<m>X^2=5.89</m>) if the null hypothesis actually was true. This is where the chi-square distribution becomes useful. If the null hypothesis was true and there was no racial bias, then <m>X^2</m> would follow a chi-square distribution, with three degrees of freedom in this case. Under certain conditions, the statistic <m>X^2</m> follows a chi-square distribution with <m>k - 1</m> degrees of freedom, where <m>k</m> is the number of bins.
      </p>
      
      <example xml:id="ex-juror-df">
        <statement>
          <p>

          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            In the jurors example, there were <m>k=4</m> categories: White, Black, Hispanic, and other. According to the rule above, the test statistic <m>X^2</m> should then follow a chi-square distribution with <m>k-1 = 3</m> degrees of freedom if <m>H_0</m> is true.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      
      <p>
        Just like we checked sample size conditions to use a normal distribution in earlier sections, we must also check a sample size condition to safely apply the chi-square distribution for <m>X^2</m>. Each expected count must be at least 5. In the juror example, the expected counts were 198, 19.25, 33, and 24.75, all easily above 5, so we can apply the chi-square model to the test statistic, <m>X^2=5.89</m>.

            The chi-square distribution and p-value are shown in <xref ref="jurorHTPValueShown"/>. Because larger chi-square values correspond to stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, we shade the upper tail to represent the p-value. Using statistical software (or the table in Appendix<nbsp/>C), we can determine that the area is 0.1171. Generally we do not reject the null hypothesis with such a large p-value. In other words, the data do not provide convincing evidence of racial bias in the juror selection.

        We can apply the chi-square testing framework to the second problem in this section: evaluating whether a certain statistical model fits a data set. Daily stock returns from the S&amp;P500 for 10 years can be used to assess whether stock activity each day is independent of the stock's behavior on previous days. This sounds like a very complex question, and it is, but a chi-square test can be used to study the problem. We will label each day as Up or Down (D) depending on whether the market was up or down that day. For example, consider the following changes in price, their new labels of up and down, and then the number of days that must be observed before each Up day:

        If the days really are independent, then the number of days until a positive trading day should follow a geometric distribution. The geometric distribution describes the probability of waiting for the <m>k^{th}</m> trial to observe the first success. Here each up day (Up) represents a success, and down (D) days represent failures. In the data above, it took only one day until the market was up, so the first wait time was 1 day. It took two more days before we observed our next Up trading day, and two more for the third Up day. We would like to determine if these counts (1, 2, 2, 1, 4, and so on) follow the geometric distribution. <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade"/> shows the number of waiting days for a positive trading day during 10 years for the S&amp;P500.

        We consider how many days one must wait until observing an Up day on the S&amp;P500 stock index. If the stock activity was independent from one day to the next and the probability of a positive trading day was constant, then we would expect this waiting time to follow a <em>geometric distribution</em>. We can organize this into a hypothesis framework:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><m>H_0</m>: The stock market being up or down on a given day is independent from all other days. We will consider the number of days that pass until an Up day is observed. Under this hypothesis, the number of days until an Up day should follow a geometric distribution.</li>
        <li><m>H_A</m>: The stock market being up or down on a given day is not independent from all other days. Since we know the number of days until an Up day would follow a geometric distribution under the null, we look for deviations from the geometric distribution, which would support the alternative hypothesis.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are important implications in our result for stock traders: if information from past trading days is useful in telling what will happen today, that information may provide an advantage over other traders.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We consider data for the S&amp;P500 and summarize the waiting times in <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade2"/> and <xref ref="geomFitEvaluationForSP500"/>. The S&amp;P500 was positive on 54.5% of those days.

          <description>A side-by-side bar plot is shown for the variable "Wait Until Positive Day", where the two groups shown for the bars are "Observed counts" and "Expected counts". The horizontal axis shows values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and "7+". The bar heights highest for "1" at roughly 715 for Observed and 740 for Expected. The bar heights for "2" are about half as high as at "1", with values of about 370 for Observed and 340 for Expected. The bar heights for "3" are about another half has high at about 150 for each for observed and expected. The values at 5, 6, and 7+ are all relatively small, at or below about 30.</description>

      <p>
        Because applying the chi-square framework requires expected counts to be at least 5, we have <em>binned</em> together all the cases where the waiting time was at least 7 days to ensure each expected count is well above this minimum. The actual data, shown in the <em>Observed</em> row in <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade2"/>, can be compared to the expected counts from the <em>Geometric Model</em> row. The method for computing expected counts is discussed in <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade2"/>. In general, the expected counts are determined by (1) identifying the null proportion associated with each bin, then (2) multiplying each null proportion by the total count to obtain the expected counts. That is, this strategy identifies what proportion of the total count we would expect to be in each bin.

            It may be tempting to think the market is "due" for an Up day if there have been several consecutive days where it has been down. However, we haven't found strong evidence that there's any such property where the market is "due" for a correction. At the very least, the analysis suggests any dependence between days is very weak.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        A two-way table (also called a <term>contingency table</term>) summarizes data for two
        categorical variables. We often want to know: Are these two variables independent, or is
        there an association between them?

      <title>Two-Way Tables and Expected Counts</title>
      
      <p>
        In a two-way table, we organize data by two categorical variables. To test for independence,
        we compare observed counts to expected counts under the assumption that the variables are
        independent.

          The chi-square test for independence tells us <em>whether</em> there is an association,

      <ul>
        <li>Chi-square tests can only establish whether an association exists; they do not

            consider combining categories or using an alternative test (such as Fisher's exact test).</li>
        <li>Large sample sizes can make even trivial differences statistically significant. Always
            consider practical significance alongside statistical significance.</li>
