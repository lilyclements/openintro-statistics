  <title>Inference for Categorical Data</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we apply the methods and ideas from Chapter 5 in several contexts for
      categorical data. We'll start by revisiting what we learned for a single proportion, where
      the normal distribution can be used to model the uncertainty in the sample proportion. Next,
      we apply these same ideas to analyze the difference of two proportions using the normal model.
      Later in the chapter, we apply inference techniques to contingency tables; while we will use
      a different distribution in this context, the core ideas of hypothesis testing remain the same.

    <title>Inference for a single proportion</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        We encountered inference methods for a single proportion in Chapter<nbsp/>5, exploring point estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests. In this section, we'll do a review of these topics and also how to choose an appropriate sample size when collecting data for single proportion contexts.

      <title>Identifying when the sample proportion is nearly normal</title>
      
      <p>
        A sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> can be modeled using a normal distribution when the sample observations are independent and the sample size is sufficiently large.
      </p>
      
      <assemblage xml:id="assem-sampling-dist-p-hat">
        <title>Sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m></title>
        <p>
          The sampling distribution for <m>\hat{p}</m> based on a sample of size <m>n</m> from a population with a true proportion <m>p</m> is nearly normal when:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The sample's observations are independent, e.g. are from a simple random sample.</li>
          <li>We expected to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, i.e. <m>np \geq 10</m> and <m>n(1-p) \geq 10</m>. This is called the <term>success-failure condition</term>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          When these conditions are met, then the sampling distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> is nearly normal with mean <m>p</m> and standard error <m>SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}</m>.
        </p>
      </assemblage>
      
      <p>
        Typically we don't know the true proportion <m>p</m>, so we substitute some value to check conditions and estimate the standard error. For confidence intervals, the sample proportion <m>\hat{p}</m> is used to check the success-failure condition and compute the standard error. For hypothesis tests, typically the null value<mdash/>that is, the proportion claimed in the null hypothesis<mdash/>is used in place of <m>p</m>.

      <title>Confidence intervals for a proportion</title>
      
      <p>
        A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the parameter <m>p</m>, and when <m>\hat{p}</m> can be modeled using a normal distribution, the confidence interval for <m>p</m> takes the form

          <p>
            We also must check the success-failure condition, which we do using <m>\hat{p}</m> in place of <m>p</m> when computing a confidence interval:

        To apply the normal distribution framework in the context of a hypothesis test for a proportion, the independence and success-failure conditions must be satisfied. In a hypothesis test, the success-failure condition is checked using the null proportion: we verify <m>np_0</m> and <m>n(1-p_0)</m> are at least 10, where <m>p_0</m> is the null value.

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-conditions-not-met">
      <title>When one or more conditions aren't met</title>
      
      <p>
        We've spent a lot of time discussing conditions for when <m>\hat{p}</m> can be reasonably modeled by a normal distribution. What happens when the success-failure condition fails? What about when the independence condition fails? In either case, the general ideas of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests remain the same, but the strategy or technique used to generate the interval or p-value change.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the success-failure condition isn't met for a hypothesis test, we can simulate the null distribution of <m>\hat{p}</m> using the null value, <m>p_0</m>. The simulation concept is similar to the ideas used in the malaria case study presented in Section<nbsp/>5.1, and an online section outlines this strategy: <url href="http://www.openintro.org/r?go=stat_sim_prop_ht">www.openintro.org/r?go=stat_sim_prop_ht</url>
      </p>
      <p>
        For a confidence interval when the success-failure condition isn't met, we can use what's called the <term>Clopper-Pearson interval</term>. The details are beyond the scope of this book. However, there are many internet resources covering this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The independence condition is a more nuanced requirement. When it isn't met, it is important to understand how and why it isn't met. For example, if we took a cluster sample (see Section<nbsp/>1.3), suitable statistical methods are available but would be beyond the scope of even most second or third courses in statistics. On the other hand, we'd be stretched to find any method that we could confidently apply to correct the inherent biases of data from a convenience sample.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this book is scoped to well-constrained statistical problems, do remember that this is just the first book in what is a large library of statistical methods that are suitable for a very wide range of data and contexts.

      <title>Choosing a sample size when estimating a proportion</title>
      
      <p>
        When collecting data, we choose a sample size suitable for the purpose of the study. Often times this means choosing a sample size large enough that the <term>margin of error</term><mdash/>which is the part we add and subtract from the point estimate in a confidence interval<mdash/>is sufficiently small that the sample is useful. For example, our task might be to find a sample size <m>n</m> so that the sample proportion is within <m>\pm 0.04</m> of the actual proportion in a 95% confidence interval.
      </p>

            Our goal is to find the smallest sample size <m>n</m> so that this margin of error is smaller than 0.04. For a 95% confidence level, the value <m>z^{\star}</m> corresponds to 1.96:

            There are two unknowns in the equation: <m>p</m> and <m>n</m>. If we have an estimate of <m>p</m>, perhaps from a prior survey, we could enter in that value and solve for <m>n</m>. If we have no such estimate, we must use some other value for <m>p</m>. It turns out that the margin of error is largest when <m>p</m> is 0.5, so we typically use this <em>worst case value</em> if no estimate of the proportion is available:

The quality control team has monitored the last three tire models produced by the factory, failing 1.7% of tires in the first model, 6.2% of the second model, and 1.3% of the third model. The manager would like to examine enough tires to estimate the failure rate of the new tire model to within about 1% with a 90% confidence level. There are three different failure rates to choose from. Perform the sample size computation for each separately, and identify three sample sizes to consider.

            A similar computation can be accomplished using 0.062 and 0.013 for <m>p</m>, and you should verify that using these proportions results in minimum sample sizes of 1574 and 348 tires, respectively.

          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We complete the same computations as before, except now we use 0.70 instead of 0.5 for <m>p</m>:
          </p>
          <md>
            <mrow>1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \amp \approx 1.96\times \sqrt{\frac{0.70(1-0.70)}{n}} \leq 0.05</mrow>
            <mrow>n \amp \geq 322.7</mrow>
          </md>
          <p>
            A sample size of 323 or more would be reasonable. (Reminder: always round up for sample size calculations!) Given that we plan to track this poll over time, we also may want to periodically repeat these calculations to ensure that we're being thoughtful in our sample size recommendations in case the baseline rate fluctuates.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        We would like to extend the methods from Section<nbsp/><xref ref="singleProportion"/> to apply confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to differences in population proportions: <m>p_1 - p_2</m>. In our investigations, we'll identify a reasonable point estimate of <m>p_1 - p_2</m> based on the sample, and you may have already guessed its form: <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m>. Next, we'll apply the same processes we used in the single-proportion context: we verify that the point estimate can be modeled using a normal distribution, we compute the estimate's standard error, and we apply our inferential framework.

      <title>Sampling distribution of the difference of two proportions</title>
      
      <p>
        Like with <m>\hat{p}</m>, the difference of two sample proportions <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m> can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met. First, we require a broader independence condition, and secondly, the success-failure condition must be met by both groups.

        We can apply the generic confidence interval formula for a difference of two proportions, where we use <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m> as the point estimate and substitute the <m>SE</m> formula:

            We consider an experiment for patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. These patients were randomly divided into a treatment group where they received a blood thinner or the control group where they did not receive a blood thinner. The outcome variable of interest was whether the patients survived for at least 24 hours. The results are shown in <xref ref="resultsForCPRStudyInSmallSampleSection"/>. Check whether we can model the difference in sample proportions using the normal distribution.

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We first check for independence: since this is a randomized experiment, this condition is satisfied.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, we check the success-failure condition for each group. We have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each experiment arm (11, 14, 39, 26), so this condition is also satisfied.
          </p>
          <p>
            With both conditions satisfied, the difference in sample proportions can be reasonably modeled using a normal distribution for these data.

      <title>Hypothesis tests for the difference of two proportions</title>
      
      <p>
        A mammogram is an X-ray procedure used to check for breast cancer. Whether mammograms should be used is part of a controversial discussion, and it's the topic of our next example where we learn about 2-proportion hypothesis tests when <m>H_0</m> is <m>p_1 - p_2 = 0</m> (or equivalently, <m>p_1 = p_2</m>).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A 30-year study was conducted with nearly 90,000 female participants. During a 5-year screening period, each woman was randomized to one of two groups: in the first group, women received regular mammograms to screen for breast cancer, and in the second group, women received regular non-mammogram breast cancer exams. No intervention was made during the following 25 years of the study, and we'll consider death resulting from breast cancer over the full 30-year period. Results from the study are summarized in <xref ref="mammogramStudySummaryTable"/>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If mammograms are much more effective than non-mammogram breast cancer exams, then we would expect to see additional deaths from breast cancer in the control group. On the other hand, if mammograms are not as effective as regular breast cancer exams, we would expect to see an increase in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram group.

        In Example<nbsp/><xref ref="condFormammogramStudySummaryTableNormalInference"/>, we will check the conditions for using a normal distribution to analyze the results of the study. The details are very similar to that of confidence intervals. However, when the null hypothesis is that <m>p_1 - p_2 = 0</m>, we use a special proportion called the <term>pooled proportion</term> to check the success-failure condition:
      </p>

        This proportion is an estimate of the breast cancer death rate across the entire study, and it's our best estimate of the proportions <m>p_{mgm}</m> and <m>p_{ctrl}</m> <em>if the null hypothesis is true that <m>p_{mgm} = p_{ctrl}</m></em>. We will also use this pooled proportion when computing the standard error.

          <p>
            The success-failure condition is satisfied since all values are at least 10. With both conditions satisfied, we can safely model the difference in proportions using a normal distribution.

      <p>
        Can we conclude that mammograms have no benefits or harm? Here are a few considerations to keep in mind when reviewing the mammogram study as well as any other medical study:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We do not reject the null hypothesis, which means we don't have sufficient evidence to conclude that mammograms reduce or increase breast cancer deaths.
        </li>
        <li>
          If mammograms are helpful or harmful, the data suggest the effect isn't very large.
        </li>
        <li>
          Are mammograms more or less expensive than a non-mammogram breast exam? If one option is much more expensive than the other and doesn't offer clear benefits, then we should lean towards the less expensive option.
        </li>
        <li>
          The study's authors also found that mammograms led to overdiagnosis of breast cancer, which means some breast cancers were found (or thought to be found) but that these cancers would not cause symptoms during patients' lifetimes. That is, something else would kill the patient before breast cancer symptoms appeared. This means some patients may have been treated for breast cancer unnecessarily, and this treatment is another cost to consider. It is also important to recognize that overdiagnosis can cause unnecessary physical or emotional harm to patients.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These considerations highlight the complexity around medical care and treatment recommendations. Experts and medical boards who study medical treatments use considerations like those above to provide their best recommendation based on the current evidence.

The sample is not necessarily random, so to proceed we must assume the blades are all independent; for this sample we will suppose this assumption is reasonable, but the engineer would be more knowledgeable as to whether this assumption is appropriate. The success-failure condition also holds for each sample. Thus, the difference in sample proportions, <m>0.958 - 0.899 = 0.059</m>, can be said to come from a nearly normal distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The standard error is computed using the two sample proportions since we do not use a pooled proportion for this context:
          </p>
          <md>
            <mrow>SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.958(1-0.958)}{1000} + \frac{0.899(1-0.899)}{1000}} = 0.0114</mrow>
          </md>
          <p>
            In this hypothesis test, because the null is that <m>p_1 - p_2 = 0.03</m>, the sample proportions were used for the standard error calculation rather than a pooled proportion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, we compute the test statistic and use it to find the p-value, which is depicted in <xref ref="bladesTwoSampleHTPValueQC"/>.
          </p>
          <md>
            <mrow>Z = \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE} = \frac{0.059 - 0.03}{0.0114} = 2.54</mrow>
          </md>
          <p>
            Using a standard normal distribution for this test statistic, we identify the right tail area as 0.006, and we double it to get the p-value: 0.012. We reject the null hypothesis because 0.012 is less than 0.05. Since we observed a larger-than-3% increase in blades that pass inspection, we have statistically significant evidence that the higher-quality blades pass inspection <em>more than</em> 3% as often as the currently used blades, exceeding the company's claims.

      <title>Examining the standard error formula (special topic)</title>
      
      <p>
        This subsection covers more theoretical topics that offer deeper insights into the origins of the standard error formula for the difference of two proportions. Ultimately, all of the standard error formulas we encounter in this chapter and in Chapter<nbsp/><xref ref="ch-inference-for-means"/> can be derived from the probability principles of Section<nbsp/><xref ref="sec-random-variables"/>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The formula for the standard error of the difference in two proportions can be deconstructed into the formulas for the standard errors of the individual sample proportions. Recall that the standard error of the individual sample proportions <m>\hat{p}_1</m> and <m>\hat{p}_2</m> are
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>SE_{\hat{p}_1} = \sqrt{\frac{{p}_1 (1 - {p}_1)}{n_1}} \qquad SE_{\hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{{p}_2 (1 - {p}_2)}{n_2}}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        The standard error of the difference of two sample proportions can be deconstructed from the standard errors of the separate sample proportions:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>SE_{\hat{p}_{1} - \hat{p}_{2}} = \sqrt{SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2} = \sqrt{\frac{{p}_1 (1 - {p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{{p}_2 (1 - {p}_2)}{n_2}}</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        This special relationship follows from probability theory.

          <p>
            The standard error squared represents the variance of the estimate. If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are two random variables with variances <m>\sigma_x^2</m> and <m>\sigma_y^2</m>, then the variance of <m>X - Y</m> is <m>\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2</m>. Likewise, the variance corresponding to <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m> is <m>\sigma_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + \sigma_{\hat{p}_2}^2</m>. Because <m>\sigma_{\hat{p}_1}^2</m> and <m>\sigma_{\hat{p}_2}^2</m> are just another way of writing <m>SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2</m> and  <m>SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2</m>, the variance associated with <m>\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2</m> may be written as <m>SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2</m>.

            A "social experiment" conducted by a TV program questioned what people do when they see a very obviously bruised woman getting picked on by her boyfriend. On two different occasions at the same restaurant, the same couple was depicted. In one scenario the woman was dressed "provocatively" and in the other scenario the woman was dressed "conservatively". The table below shows how many restaurant diners were present under each scenario, and whether or not they intervened.

            The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was officially designated a heart transplant candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and might benefit from a new heart.

            In July 2008 the US National Institutes of Health announced that it was stopping a clinical study early because of unexpected results. The study population consisted of HIV-infected women in sub-Saharan Africa who had been given single dose Nevaripine (a treatment for HIV) while giving birth, to prevent transmission of HIV to the infant. The study was a randomized comparison of continued treatment of a woman (after successful childbirth) with Nevaripine vs Lopinavir, a second drug used to treat HIV. 240 women participated in the study; 120 were randomized to each of the two treatments. Twenty-four weeks after starting the study treatment, each woman was tested to determine if the HIV infection was becoming worse (an outcome called <em>virologic failure</em>). Twenty-six of the 120 women treated with Nevaripine experienced virologic failure, while 10 of the 120 women treated with the other drug experienced virologic failure.

    <title>Testing for goodness of fit using chi-square</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this section, we develop a method for assessing a null model when the data are binned. This technique is commonly used in two circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Given a sample of cases that can be classified into several groups, determine if the sample is representative of the general population.</li>
        <li>Evaluate whether data resemble a particular distribution, such as a normal distribution or a geometric distribution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each of these scenarios can be addressed using the same statistical test: a chi-square test.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first case, we consider data from a random sample of 275 jurors in a small county. Jurors identified their racial group, as shown in <xref ref="juryRepresentationAndCityRepresentationForRace"/>, and we would like to determine if these jurors are racially representative of the population. If the jury is representative of the population, then the proportions in the sample should roughly reflect the population of eligible jurors, i.e. registered voters.

      <p>
        While the proportions in the juries do not precisely represent the population proportions, it is unclear whether these data provide convincing evidence that the sample is not representative. If the jurors really were randomly sampled from the registered voters, we might expect small differences due to chance. However, unusually large differences may provide convincing evidence that the juries were not representative.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A second application, assessing the fit of a distribution, is presented at the end of this section. Daily stock returns from the S&amp;P500 for 25 years are used to assess whether stock activity each day is independent of the stock's behavior on previous days.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In these problems, we would like to examine all bins simultaneously, not simply compare one or two bins at a time, which will require us to develop a new test statistic.

        The sample proportion represented from each race among the 275 jurors was not a precise match for any ethnic group. While some sampling variation is expected, we would expect the sample proportions to be fairly similar to the population proportions if there is no bias on juries. We need to test whether the differences are strong enough to provide convincing evidence that the jurors are not a random sample. These ideas can be organized into hypotheses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><m>H_0</m>: The jurors are a random sample, i.e. there is no racial bias in who serves on a jury, and the observed counts reflect natural sampling fluctuation.</li>
        <li><m>H_A</m>: The jurors are not randomly sampled, i.e. there is racial bias in juror selection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To evaluate these hypotheses, we quantify how different the observed counts are from the expected counts. Strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis would come in the form of unusually large deviations in the groups from what would be expected based on sampling variation alone.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection xml:id="chiSquareTestStatistic">
      <title>The chi-square test statistic</title>
      
      <p>
        In previous hypothesis tests, we constructed a test statistic of the following form:
      </p>
      <me>
        \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{\text{SE of point estimate}}
      </me>
      <p>
        This construction was based on (1) identifying the difference between a point estimate and an expected value if the null hypothesis was true, and (2) standardizing that difference using the standard error of the point estimate. These two ideas will help in the construction of an appropriate test statistic for count data.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Our strategy will be to first compute the difference between the observed counts and the counts we would expect if the null hypothesis was true, then we will standardize the difference:
      </p>
      <me>
        Z_{1} = \frac{\text{observed White count} - \text{null White count}}{\text{SE of observed White count}}
      </me>
      <p>
        The standard error for the point estimate of the count in binned data is the square root of the count under the null.<fn>Using some of the rules learned in earlier chapters, we might think that the standard error would be <m>np(1-p)</m>, where <m>n</m> is the sample size and <m>p</m> is the proportion in the population. This would be correct if we were looking only at one count. However, we are computing many standardized differences and adding them together. It can be shown<mdash/>though not here<mdash/>that the square root of the count is a better way to standardize the count differences.</fn> Therefore:
      </p>
      <me>
        Z_1 = \frac{205 - 198}{\sqrt{198}} = 0.50
      </me>
      <p>
        The fraction is very similar to previous test statistics: first compute a difference, then standardize it. These computations should also be completed for the Black, Hispanic, and other groups:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{Black} \qquad Z_2 \amp = \frac{26-19.25}{\sqrt{19.25}}=1.54</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{Hispanic} \qquad Z_3 \amp = \frac{25-33}{\sqrt{33}}=-1.39</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{Other} \qquad Z_4 \amp = \frac{19-24.75}{\sqrt{24.75}}=-1.16</mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        We would like to use a single test statistic to determine if these four standardized differences are irregularly far from zero. That is, <m>Z_1</m>, <m>Z_2</m>, <m>Z_3</m>, and <m>Z_4</m> must be combined somehow to help determine if they<mdash/>as a group<mdash/>tend to be unusually far from zero. A first thought might be to take the absolute value of these four standardized differences and add them up:
      </p>
      <me>
        |Z_1| + |Z_2| + |Z_3| + |Z_4| = 4.58
      </me>
      <p>
        Indeed, this does give one number summarizing how far the actual counts are from what was expected. However, it is more common to add the squared values:
      </p>
      <me>
        Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + Z_3^2 + Z_4^2 = 5.89
      </me>
      <p>
        Squaring each standardized difference before adding them together does two things:
      </p>

        <li>Any standardized difference that is squared will now be positive.</li>
        <li>Differences that already look unusual<mdash/>e.g. a standardized difference of 2.5<mdash/>will become much larger after being squared.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The test statistic <m>X^2</m>, which is the sum of the <m>Z^2</m> values, is generally used for these reasons. We can also write an equation for <m>X^2</m> using the observed counts and null counts:
      </p>
      <me>
        X^2 = \frac{(\text{observed count}_1 - \text{null count}_1)^2}{\text{null count}_1} + \dots + \frac{(\text{observed count}_4 - \text{null count}_4)^2}{\text{null count}_4}
      </me>
      <p>
        The final number <m>X^2</m> summarizes how strongly the observed counts tend to deviate from the null counts. In Section<nbsp/><xref ref="pValueForAChiSquareTest"/>, we will see that if the null hypothesis is true, then <m>X^2</m> follows a new distribution called a <em>chi-square distribution</em>. Using this distribution, we will be able to obtain a p-value to evaluate the hypotheses.

      <title>The chi-square distribution and finding areas</title>
      
      <p>
        The <term>chi-square distribution</term> is sometimes used to characterize data sets and statistics that are always positive and typically right skewed. Recall a normal distribution had two parameters<mdash/>mean and standard deviation<mdash/>that could be used to describe its exact characteristics. The chi-square distribution has just one parameter called <term>degrees of freedom (df)</term>, which influences the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.

        Our principal interest in the chi-square distribution is the calculation of p-values, which (as we have seen before) is related to finding the relevant area in the tail of a distribution. The most common ways to do this are using computer software, using a graphing calculator, or using a table. For folks wanting to use the table option, we provide an outline of how to read the chi-square table in Appendix<nbsp/>C, which is also where you may find the table. For the examples below, use your preferred approach to confirm you get the same answers.

      <title>Finding a p-value for a chi-square distribution</title>
      
      <p>
        In Section<nbsp/><xref ref="chiSquareTestStatistic"/>, we identified a new test statistic (<m>X^2</m>) within the context of assessing whether there was evidence of racial bias in how jurors were sampled. The null hypothesis represented the claim that jurors were randomly sampled and there was no racial bias. The alternative hypothesis was that there was racial bias in how the jurors were sampled.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We determined that a large <m>X^2</m> value would suggest strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis: that there was racial bias. However, we could not quantify what the chance was of observing such a large test statistic (<m>X^2=5.89</m>) if the null hypothesis actually was true. This is where the chi-square distribution becomes useful. If the null hypothesis was true and there was no racial bias, then <m>X^2</m> would follow a chi-square distribution, with three degrees of freedom in this case. Under certain conditions, the statistic <m>X^2</m> follows a chi-square distribution with <m>k - 1</m> degrees of freedom, where <m>k</m> is the number of bins.
      </p>
      
      <example xml:id="ex-juror-df">
        <statement>
          <p>
            How many categories were there in the juror example? How many degrees of freedom should be associated with the chi-square distribution used for <m>X^2</m>?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            In the jurors example, there were <m>k=4</m> categories: White, Black, Hispanic, and other. According to the rule above, the test statistic <m>X^2</m> should then follow a chi-square distribution with <m>k-1 = 3</m> degrees of freedom if <m>H_0</m> is true.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      
      <p>
        Just like we checked sample size conditions to use a normal distribution in earlier sections, we must also check a sample size condition to safely apply the chi-square distribution for <m>X^2</m>. Each expected count must be at least 5. In the juror example, the expected counts were 198, 19.25, 33, and 24.75, all easily above 5, so we can apply the chi-square model to the test statistic, <m>X^2=5.89</m>.

          </p>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The chi-square distribution and p-value are shown in <xref ref="jurorHTPValueShown"/>. Because larger chi-square values correspond to stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, we shade the upper tail to represent the p-value. Using statistical software (or the table in Appendix<nbsp/>C), we can determine that the area is 0.1171. Generally we do not reject the null hypothesis with such a large p-value. In other words, the data do not provide convincing evidence of racial bias in the juror selection.

        We can apply the chi-square testing framework to the second problem in this section: evaluating whether a certain statistical model fits a data set. Daily stock returns from the S&amp;P500 for 10 years can be used to assess whether stock activity each day is independent of the stock's behavior on previous days. This sounds like a very complex question, and it is, but a chi-square test can be used to study the problem. We will label each day as Up or Down (D) depending on whether the market was up or down that day. For example, consider the following changes in price, their new labels of up and down, and then the number of days that must be observed before each Up day:

        If the days really are independent, then the number of days until a positive trading day should follow a geometric distribution. The geometric distribution describes the probability of waiting for the <m>k^{th}</m> trial to observe the first success. Here each up day (Up) represents a success, and down (D) days represent failures. In the data above, it took only one day until the market was up, so the first wait time was 1 day. It took two more days before we observed our next Up trading day, and two more for the third Up day. We would like to determine if these counts (1, 2, 2, 1, 4, and so on) follow the geometric distribution. <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade"/> shows the number of waiting days for a positive trading day during 10 years for the S&amp;P500.

        We consider how many days one must wait until observing an Up day on the S&amp;P500 stock index. If the stock activity was independent from one day to the next and the probability of a positive trading day was constant, then we would expect this waiting time to follow a <em>geometric distribution</em>. We can organize this into a hypothesis framework:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><m>H_0</m>: The stock market being up or down on a given day is independent from all other days. We will consider the number of days that pass until an Up day is observed. Under this hypothesis, the number of days until an Up day should follow a geometric distribution.</li>
        <li><m>H_A</m>: The stock market being up or down on a given day is not independent from all other days. Since we know the number of days until an Up day would follow a geometric distribution under the null, we look for deviations from the geometric distribution, which would support the alternative hypothesis.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are important implications in our result for stock traders: if information from past trading days is useful in telling what will happen today, that information may provide an advantage over other traders.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We consider data for the S&amp;P500 and summarize the waiting times in <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade2"/> and <xref ref="geomFitEvaluationForSP500"/>. The S&amp;P500 was positive on 54.5% of those days.

        Because applying the chi-square framework requires expected counts to be at least 5, we have <em>binned</em> together all the cases where the waiting time was at least 7 days to ensure each expected count is well above this minimum. The actual data, shown in the <em>Observed</em> row in <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade2"/>, can be compared to the expected counts from the <em>Geometric Model</em> row. The method for computing expected counts is discussed in <xref ref="sAndP500TimeToPosTrade2"/>. In general, the expected counts are determined by (1) identifying the null proportion associated with each bin, then (2) multiplying each null proportion by the total count to obtain the expected counts. That is, this strategy identifies what proportion of the total count we would expect to be in each bin.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        We all buy used products <mdash/> cars, computers, textbooks, and so on <mdash/> and we sometimes assume the sellers of those products will be forthright about any underlying problems with what they're selling. This is not something we should take for granted. Researchers recruited 219 participants in a study where they would sell a used iPod<fn>For readers not as old as the authors, an iPod is basically an iPhone without any cellular service, assuming it was one of the later generations. Earlier generations were more basic.</fn> that was known to have frozen twice in the past. The participants were incentivized to get as much money as they could for the iPod since they would receive a 5% cut of the sale on top of $10 for participating. The researchers wanted to understand what types of questions would elicit the seller to disclose the freezing issue.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Unbeknownst to the participants who were the sellers in the study, the buyers were collaborating with the researchers to evaluate the influence of different questions on the likelihood of getting the sellers to disclose the past issues with the iPod. The scripted buyers started with <q>Okay, I guess I'm supposed to go first. So you've had the iPod for 2 years <ellipsis/></q> and ended with one of three questions:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>General: What can you tell me about it?</li>
        <li>Positive Assumption: It doesn't have any problems, does it?</li>
        <li>Negative Assumption: What problems does it have?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        The question is the treatment given to the sellers, and the response is whether the question prompted them to disclose the freezing issue with the iPod. The results are shown in <xref ref="table-ipod-ask-data-summary"/>, and the data suggest that asking <em>What problems does it have?</em> was the most effective at getting the seller to disclose the past freezing issues. However, you should also be asking yourself: could we see these results due to chance alone, or is this in fact evidence that some questions are more effective for getting at the truth?

        The hypothesis test for the iPod experiment is really about assessing whether there is statistically significant evidence of the success each question had on getting the participant to disclose the problem with the iPod. In other words, the goal is to check whether the buyer's question was independent of whether the seller disclosed a problem.

      <title>Expected counts in two-way tables</title>
      
      <p>
        Like with one-way tables, we will need to compute estimated counts for each cell in a two-way table.
      </p>
      
      <example xml:id="ex-ipod-compute-exp-aa">
        <title>Computing expected counts for the General group</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            From the experiment, we can compute the proportion of all sellers who disclosed the freezing problem as <m>61/219 = 0.2785</m>. If there really is no difference among the questions and 27.85% of sellers were going to disclose the freezing problem no matter the question that was put to them, how many of the 73 people in the General group would we have expected to disclose the freezing problem?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We would predict that <m>0.2785 \times 73 = 20.33</m> sellers would disclose the problem. Obviously we observed fewer than this, though it is not yet clear if that is due to chance variation or whether that is because the questions vary in how effective they are at getting to the truth.

      <exercise xml:id="exercise-ipod-compute-exp-bb">
        <statement>
          <p>
            If the questions were actually equally effective, meaning about 27.85% of respondents would disclose the freezing issue regardless of what question they were asked, about how many sellers would we expect to <em>hide</em> the freezing problem from the Positive Assumption group?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We would expect <m>(1 - 0.2785) \times 73 = 52.67</m>. It is okay that this result, like the result from <xref ref="ex-ipod-compute-exp-aa"/>, is a fraction.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </exercise>
      
      <p>
        We can compute the expected number of sellers who we would expect to disclose or hide the freezing issue for all groups, if the questions had no impact on what they disclosed, using the same strategy employed in <xref ref="ex-ipod-compute-exp-aa"/> and <xref ref="exercise-ipod-compute-exp-bb"/>. These expected counts were used to construct <xref ref="table-ipod-ask-expected"/>, which is the same as <xref ref="table-ipod-ask-data-summary"/>, except now the expected counts have been added in parentheses.

        The examples and exercises above provided some help in computing expected counts. In general, expected counts for a two-way table may be computed using the row totals, column totals, and the table total. For instance, if there was no difference between the groups, then about 27.85% of each column should be in the first row:
      </p>
      
      <md>
        <mrow>0.2785 \times (\text{column 1 total}) \amp= 20.33</mrow>
        <mrow>0.2785 \times (\text{column 2 total}) \amp= 20.33</mrow>
        <mrow>0.2785 \times (\text{column 3 total}) \amp= 20.33</mrow>
      </md>
      
      <p>
        Looking back to how 0.2785 was computed <mdash/> as the fraction of sellers who disclosed the freezing issue (<m>61/219</m>) <mdash/> these three expected counts could have been computed as
      </p>
      
      <md>
        <mrow>\left(\frac{\text{row 1 total}}{\text{table total}}\right) \text{(column 1 total)} \amp= 20.33</mrow>
        <mrow>\left(\frac{\text{row 1 total}}{\text{table total}}\right) \text{(column 2 total)} \amp= 20.33</mrow>
        <mrow>\left(\frac{\text{row 1 total}}{\text{table total}}\right) \text{(column 3 total)} \amp= 20.33</mrow>
      </md>
      
      <p>
        This leads us to a general formula for computing expected counts in a two-way table when we would like to test whether there is strong evidence of an association between the column variable and row variable.

      <p>
        Just like before, this test statistic follows a chi-square distribution. However, the degrees of freedom are computed a little differently for a two-way table.<fn>Recall: in the one-way table, the degrees of freedom was the number of cells minus 1.</fn> For two-way tables, the degrees of freedom is equal to
      </p>
      
      <me>
        df = \text{(number of rows minus 1)}\times \text{(number of columns minus 1)}
      </me>
      
      <p>
        In our example, the degrees of freedom parameter is
      </p>
      
      <me>
        df = (2-1)\times (3-1) = 2
      </me>
      
      <p>
        If the null hypothesis is true (i.e. the questions had no impact on the sellers in the experiment), then the test statistic <m>X^2 = 40.13</m> closely follows a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. Using this information, we can compute the p-value for the test, which is depicted in <xref ref="fig-ipod-chi-sq-tail"/>.

            Using a computer, we can compute a very precise value for the tail area above <m>X^2 = 40.13</m> for a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom: 0.000000002. (If using the table in Appendix<nbsp/>C, we would identify the p-value is smaller than 0.001.) Using a significance level of <m>\alpha=0.05</m>, the null hypothesis is rejected since the p-value is smaller. That is, the data provide convincing evidence that the question asked did affect a seller's likelihood to tell the truth about problems with the iPod.

        <statement>
          <p>
            A teacher wanting to increase the active learning component of her course is concerned about student reactions to changes she is planning to make. She conducts a survey in her class, asking students whether they believe more active learning in the classroom (hands on exercises) instead of traditional lecture will help improve their learning. She does this at the beginning and end of the semester and wants to evaluate whether students' opinions have changed over the semester. Can she use the methods we learned in this chapter for this analysis? Explain your reasoning.

            <li>According to an online article, a report from a mobile research company indicates that 38 percent of Chinese mobile web users only access the internet through their cell phones. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if these data provide strong evidence that the proportion of Americans who only use their cell phones to access the internet is different than the Chinese proportion of 38%.</li>
            <li>Interpret the p-value in this context.</li>
            <li>Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who access the internet on their cell phones, and interpret the interval in this context.</li>

            Researchers conducted a study investigating the relationship between caffeinated coffee consumption and risk of depression in women. They collected data on 50,739 women free of depression symptoms at the start of the study in the year 1996, and these women were followed through 2006. The researchers used questionnaires to collect data on caffeinated coffee consumption, asked each individual about physician-diagnosed depression, and also asked about the use of antidepressants. The table below shows the distribution of incidences of depression by amount of caffeinated coffee consumption.
