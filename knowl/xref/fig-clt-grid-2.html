The graphs are arranged in a grid of 5 rows representing proportions 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.9 and 3 columns of sample sizes n equals 50, 100, and 250. Relative to the previous figure, which considered similar proportion scenarios but with n equals 10 and 25, the data in these graphs looks less discrete -- that is, they appear to almost be continuous. This is most evident for the largest sample sizes. Nearly all of the graphs shown also closely resemble the normal distribution, in some cases with the larger sample sizes that it resembles it so closely that there are not substantial visual differences. One aspect less evident -- but still present -- in the last figure but that continues into and becomes much more obvious in this figure, is that the distributions of the sample proportions tend to have a much smaller standard deviation with the larger sample sizes. That is, the sample proportion distributions for larger sample sizes tend to be smaller than they were for smaller sample sizes. Also, the variability within a graph also appears to be largest for the proportion p equals 0.5 than it is for the other proportions when considering a single proportion -- and this property is apparent upon inspection of a distribution based on any of the considered sample sizes."></div>
