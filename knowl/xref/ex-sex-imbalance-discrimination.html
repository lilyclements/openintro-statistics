<div class="para">Let’s consider a hypothetical company that consists of 20% women and 80% men, and we’ll suppose that the company is very large, consisting of perhaps 20,000 employees. Suppose when someone goes up for promotion at this company, 5 of their colleagues are randomly chosen to provide feedback on their work.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#ex-sex-imbalance-discrimination-2-1" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
</div> <div class="para">Now let’s imagine that 10% of the people in the company hold certain views about the other sex. That is, 10% of men hold these views about women, and similarly, 10% of women hold these views about men.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#ex-sex-imbalance-discrimination-2-2" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>

<div class="para">Let’s suppose we took 100 men who have gone up for promotion in the past few years. For these men, <span class="process-math">\(5 \times 100 = 500\)</span> random colleagues will be tapped for their feedback, of which about 20% will be women (100 women). Of these 100 women, 10 are expected to hold these views about the man they are reviewing. Then, of the 500 colleagues reviewing them, men will experience this effect by about 2% of their colleagues when they go up for promotion.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#ex-sex-imbalance-discrimination-3-1" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>

<div class="para">Let’s do a similar calculation for 100 women who have gone up for promotion in the last few years. They will also have 500 random colleagues providing feedback, of which about 400 (80%) will be men. Of these 400 men, about 40 (10%) hold these views against women. Of the 500 colleagues providing feedback on the promotion packet for these women, 8% of the colleagues hold these views against the women.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#ex-sex-imbalance-discrimination-3-2" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">🔗</a></div>
