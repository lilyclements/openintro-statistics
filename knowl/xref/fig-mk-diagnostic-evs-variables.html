Condition plot: A side-by-side box plot is shown for the condition levels of "Used" and "New". The median of "Used" is at $0 while the median of "New" is at about -$2. The boxes in each box plot ranges from about -$3 to positive $3, and the whiskers of each box plot runs from about -$10 to positive $10. There are a couple of points slightly beyond the whiskers. Photo Type plot: A side-by-side box plot is shown for the photo type levels of "Unique Photo" and "Stock Photo". The median of "Unique Photos" is at $0 while the median of "Stock Photo" is at about -$1. The boxes in each box plot ranges from about -$3 to positive $3. The whiskers of "Unique Photo" box plot ranges from about -$8 to positive $7, and the whiskers of "Stock Photo" box plot ranges from about -$11 to positive $11. There are a couple of points slightly beyond the whiskers. Number of Wheels plot: A scatterplot is shown for "Residuals" (vertical axis) against "Number of Wheels" (horizontal axis) with values from 0 to 4. For 0 wheels, the residuals largely range from -$8 to positive $10. For 1 wheel, the residuals largely range from -$10 to positive $5. For 2 wheels, the residuals largely range from -$8 to positive $10. There are two points with 3 wheels that have residuals of $6 and $11, and one point with 4 wheels that has a residual of about $0.'></div>

In the case of the stock photos variable, we see a little less variability in the unique photo group than the stock photo group. For numerical predictors, we also check for trends or other structure. We see some slight bowing in the residuals against the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">wheels</code> variable in the bottom plot.<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Figure 9.4.16"><a href="#fig-mk-diagnostic-evs-variables" title="Copy heading and permalink for Figure 9.4.16" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Figure 9.4.16">🔗</a></div></figcaption></figure><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-regression-case-study.html#fig-mk-diagnostic-evs-variables">in-context</a></span>
