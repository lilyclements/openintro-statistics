<div class="para">The probability that a random photo from the data set is about fashion is about 0.17. If we knew the machine learning classifier predicted the photo was about fashion, could we get a better estimate of the probability the photo is actually about fashion? Absolutely. To do so, we limit our view to only those 219 cases where the ML classifier predicted that the photo was about fashion and look at the fraction where the photo was actually about fashion:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
P(\text{truth is fashion} \mid \text{mach_learn is pred_fashion}) = \frac{197}{219} = 0.900
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">We call this a <dfn class="terminology">conditional probability</dfn> because we computed the probability under a condition: the ML classifier prediction said the photo was about fashion.</div>
