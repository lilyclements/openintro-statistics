<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Each day a high school football coach tells his star kicker, Brian, that he can go home after he successfully kicks four 35 yard field goals. Suppose we say each kick has a probability <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> of being successful. If <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is small — e.g. close to 0.1 — would we expect Brian to need many attempts before he successfully kicks his fourth field goal?</div>
