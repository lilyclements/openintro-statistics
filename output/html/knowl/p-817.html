<div class="para">Suppose a car insurer has determined that 88% of its drivers will not exceed their deductible in a given year. If someone at the company were to randomly draw driver files until they found one that had not exceeded their deductible, what is the expected number of drivers the insurance employee must check? What is the standard deviation of the number of driver files that must be drawn?</div>
