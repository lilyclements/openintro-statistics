<div class="para">Suppose a health insurance company found that 70% of the people they insure stay below their deductible in any given year. Each of these people can be thought of as a <dfn class="terminology">trial</dfn>. We label a person a <dfn class="terminology">success</dfn> if her healthcare costs do not exceed the deductible. We label a person a <dfn class="terminology">failure</dfn> if she does exceed her deductible in the year. Because 70% of the individuals will not hit their deductible, we denote the <dfn class="terminology">probability of a success</dfn> as <span class="process-math">\(p = 0.7\text{.}\)</span> The probability of a failure is sometimes denoted with <span class="process-math">\(q = 1 - p\text{,}\)</span> which would be 0.3 for the insurance example.</div>
