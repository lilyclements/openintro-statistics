<div class="para">Here are four examples. (i) Whether someone gets sick in the next month or not is an apparently random process with outcomes “sick” and “not”. (ii) We can <em class="emphasis">generate</em> a random process by randomly picking a person and measuring that person’s height. The outcome of this process will be a positive number. (iii) Whether the stock market goes up or down next week is a seemingly random process with possible outcomes “up”, “down”, and “no_change”. Alternatively, we could have used the percent change in the stock market as a numerical outcome. (iv) Whether your roommate cleans her dishes tonight probably seems like a random process with possible outcomes “cleans_dishes” and “leaves_dishes”.</div>
