<div class="para">Consider two news excerpts, one about smoking and dementia, and another about sleep disorders and bullying. For each, evaluate whether the conclusions are justified and what can actually be concluded from the studies described.</div> <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Researchers analyzed data on over 23,000 people aged 50-60 and found smokers were more likely to develop dementia. Can we conclude smoking causes dementia later in life? Explain.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A study collected survey data on children’s sleep habits and bullying behavior and found those with sleep problems were twice as likely to have disruptive behavior or bullying issues. Does this show sleep disorders lead to bullying? If not, how best to describe the conclusion?</div></li>
