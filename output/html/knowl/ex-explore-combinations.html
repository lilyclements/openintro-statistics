<div class="para">The formula for the number of ways to arrange <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> objects is <span class="process-math">\(n! = n \times (n-1) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1\text{.}\)</span> This exercise walks you through the derivation of this formula for a couple of special cases.</div> <div class="para">A small company has five employees: Anna, Ben, Carl, Damian, and Eddy. There are five parking spots in a row at the company, none of which are assigned, and each day the employees pull into a random parking spot. That is, all possible orderings of the cars in the row of spots are equally likely.</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">On a given day, what is the probability that the employees park in alphabetical order?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If the alphabetical order has an equal chance of occurring relative to all other possible orderings, how many ways must there be to arrange the five cars?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now consider a sample of 8 employees instead. How many possible ways are there to order these 8 employees’ cars?</div></li>
