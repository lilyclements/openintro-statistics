<div class="para">(a) First determine the probability of not winning. The tickets are sampled without replacement, which means the probability you do not win on the first draw is <span class="process-math">\(29/30\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(28/29\)</span> for the second, <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(23/24\)</span> for the seventh. The probability you win no prize is the product of these separate probabilities: <span class="process-math">\(23/30\text{.}\)</span> That is, the probability of winning a prize is <span class="process-math">\(1 - 23/30 = 7/30 = 0.233\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">(b) When the tickets are sampled with replacement, there are seven independent draws. Again we first find the probability of not winning a prize: <span class="process-math">\((29/30)^7 = 0.789\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the probability of winning (at least) one prize when drawing with replacement is 0.211.</div>
