<div class="para">When an individual trial only has two possible outcomes, often labeled as “success” or “failure”, it is called a <dfn class="terminology">Bernoulli random variable</dfn>. We chose to label a person who does not hit her deductible as a “success” and all others as “failures”. However, we could just as easily have reversed these labels. The mathematical framework we will build does not depend on which outcome is labeled a success and which a failure, as long as we are consistent.</div>
