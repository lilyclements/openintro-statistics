<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">The 52 cards are split into four <dfn class="terminology">suits</dfn>: <span class="process-math">\(\clubsuit\)</span> (club), <span class="process-math">\(\diamondsuit\)</span> (diamond), <span class="process-math">\(\heartsuit\)</span> (heart), <span class="process-math">\(\spadesuit\)</span> (spade). Each suit has its 13 cards labeled: 2, 3, …, 10, J (jack), Q (queen), K (king), and A (ace). Thus, each card is a unique combination of a suit and a label, e.g. <span class="process-math">\(4\heartsuit\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(J\clubsuit\text{.}\)</span> The 12 cards represented by the jacks, queens, and kings are called <dfn class="terminology">face cards</dfn>. The cards that are <span class="process-math">\(\diamondsuit\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\heartsuit\)</span> are typically colored red while the other two suits are typically colored black.</div></body>
