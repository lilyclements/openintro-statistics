<div class="para">While it is often assumed that the probabilities of having a boy or a girl are the same, the actual probability of having a boy is slightly higher at 0.51. Suppose a couple plans to have 3 kids.</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Use the binomial model to calculate the probability that two of them will be boys.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Write out all possible orderings of 3 children, 2 of whom are boys. Use these scenarios to calculate the same probability from part (a) but using the addition rule for disjoint outcomes. Confirm that your answers from parts (a) and (b) match.</div></li>
