<div class="para">A not-so-skilled volleyball player has a 15% chance of making the serve, which involves hitting the ball so it passes over the net on a trajectory such that it will land in the opposing team’s court. Suppose that her serves are independent of each other.</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">What is the probability that on the <span class="process-math">\(10^{th}\)</span> try she will make her <span class="process-math">\(3^{rd}\)</span> successful serve?</div></li>
