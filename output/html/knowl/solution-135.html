<div class="para">Because it took Brian six tries to get the fourth success, we know the last kick must have been a success. That leaves three successful kicks and two unsuccessful kicks (we label these as failures) that make up the first five attempts. There are ten possible sequences of these first five kicks, which are shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-brian-six-attempts.html" title="Figure 4.4.4">Figure 4.4.4</a>. If Brian achieved his fourth success (<span class="process-math">\(k=4\)</span>) on his sixth attempt (<span class="process-math">\(n=6\)</span>), then his order of successes and failures must be one of these ten possible sequences.</div>
