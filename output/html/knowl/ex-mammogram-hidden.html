<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">In Canada, about 0.35% of women over 40 will develop breast cancer in any given year. A common screening test for cancer is the mammogram, but this test is not perfect. In about 11% of patients with breast cancer, the test gives a <dfn class="terminology">false negative</dfn>: it indicates a woman does not have breast cancer when she does have breast cancer. Similarly, the test gives a <dfn class="terminology">false positive</dfn> in 7% of patients who do not have breast cancer: it indicates these patients have breast cancer when they actually do not. If we tested a random woman over 40 for breast cancer using a mammogram and the test came back positive — that is, the test suggested the patient has cancer — what is the probability that the patient actually has breast cancer?</div>
