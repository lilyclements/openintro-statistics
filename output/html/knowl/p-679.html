<div class="para">There are many techniques for doing this, and we’ll discuss three of the options.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<div class="para">The most common approach in practice is to use statistical software. For example, in the program R, we could find the area shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-sat-below-1300.html" title="Figure 4.1.12">Figure 4.1.12</a> using the following command, which takes in the Z-score and returns the lower tail area: <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pnorm(1)</code> returns <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">0.8413447</code>. According to this calculation, the region shaded that is below 1300 represents the proportion 0.841 (84.1%) of SAT test takers who had Z-scores below <span class="process-math">\(Z = 1\text{.}\)</span> More generally, we can also specify the cutoff explicitly if we also note the mean and standard deviation: <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pnorm(1300, mean = 1100, sd = 200)</code> returns <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">0.8413447</code>.</div>
<div class="para">There are many other software options, such as Python or SAS; even spreadsheet programs such as Excel and Google Sheets support these calculations.</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">A common strategy in classrooms is to use a graphing calculator, such as a TI or Casio calculator. These calculators require a series of button presses that are less concisely described. You can find instructions on using these calculators for finding tail areas of a normal distribution in the OpenIntro video library: <a class="external" href="https://www.openintro.org/videos" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://www.openintro.org/videos</code></a>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The last option for finding tail areas is to use what’s called a <dfn class="terminology">probability table</dfn>; these are occasionally used in classrooms but rarely in practice. The appendix contains such a table and a guide for how to use it.</div></li>
