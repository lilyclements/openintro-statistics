<div class="para">Consider the midterm and final for a statistics class. Suppose 13% of students earned an A on the midterm. Of those students who earned an A on the midterm, 47% received an A on the final, and 11% of the students who earned lower than an A on the midterm received an A on the final. You randomly pick up a final exam and notice the student received an A. What is the probability that this student earned an A on the midterm?</div>
