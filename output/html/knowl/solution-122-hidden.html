<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><div class="para">We are asked to determine the expected number (the mean) and the standard deviation, both of which can be directly computed from the formulas: <span class="process-math">\(\mu = np = 40 \times 0.7 = 28\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{40 \times 0.7 \times 0.3} = 2.9\text{.}\)</span> Because very roughly 95% of observations fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean (see Section 1.6.3), we would probably observe at least 22 but fewer than 34 individuals in our sample who would not exceed the deductible.</div></div></body>
