<div class="para">A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the contingency table below.</div> <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.1.5<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Migraine and acupuncture study results</figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">

<li><div class="para">Your findings so far might suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines for all people who suffer from migraines. However, this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients that are pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture in the two groups?</div></li>
