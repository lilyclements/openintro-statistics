<div class="para">There are about 8 million individuals in New York City. How many individuals might we expect to be hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), i.e. a heart attack, each day? According to historical records, the average number is about 4.4 individuals. However, we would also like to know the approximate distribution of counts. What would a histogram of the number of AMI occurrences each day look like if we recorded the daily counts over an entire year?</div>
