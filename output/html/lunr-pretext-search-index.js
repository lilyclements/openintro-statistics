  "title": "Case study: using stents to prevent strokes",
  "body": " Case study: using stents to prevent strokes  stroke   This section introduces a classic challenge in statistics: evaluating the efficacy of a medical treatment. Terms in this section, and indeed much of this chapter, will all be revisited later in the text. The plan for now is simply to get a sense of the role statistics can play in practice.  In this section we will consider an experiment that studies effectiveness of stents in treating patients at risk of stroke. Stents are devices put inside blood vessels that assist in patient recovery after cardiac events and reduce the risk of an additional heart attack or death. Many doctors have hoped that there would be similar benefits for patients at risk of stroke. We start by writing the principal question the researchers hope to answer:   Does the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke?   The researchers who asked this question conducted an experiment with 451 at-risk patients. Each volunteer patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups:      Treatment group . Patients in the treatment group received a stent and medical management. The medical management included medications, management of risk factors, and help in lifestyle modification.     Control group . Patients in the control group received the same medical management as the treatment group, but they did not receive stents.     Researchers randomly assigned 224 patients to the treatment group and 227 to the control group. In this study, the control group provides a reference point against which we can measure the medical impact of stents in the treatment group.  Researchers studied the effect of stents at two time points: 30 days after enrollment and 365 days after enrollment. The results of 5 patients are summarized in . Patient outcomes are recorded as stroke or no event , representing whether or not the patient had a stroke at the end of a time period.    Results for five patients from the stent study    Patient  group  0-30 days  0-365 days    1  treatment  no event  no event    2  treatment  stroke  stroke    3  treatment  no event  no event          450  control  no event  no event    451  control  no event  no event     Considering data from each patient individually would be a long, cumbersome path towards answering the original research question. Instead, performing a statistical data analysis allows us to consider all of the data at once. summarizes the raw data in a more helpful way. In this table, we can quickly see what happened over the entire study. For instance, to identify the number of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke within 30 days, we look on the left-side of the table at the intersection of the treatment and stroke: 33.   Descriptive statistics for the stent study     0-30 days   0-365 days     stroke  no event   stroke  no event    treatment  33  191   45  179    control  13  214   28  199    Total  46  405   73  378     Computing proportions from the stent study  Of the 224 patients in the treatment group, 45 had a stroke by the end of the first year. Using these two numbers, compute the proportion of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke by the end of their first year.   The proportion of the 224 patients who had a stroke within 365 days: .   We can compute summary statistics from the table. A summary statistic is a single number summarizing a large amount of data. For instance, the primary results of the study after 1 year could be described by two summary statistics: the proportion of people who had a stroke in the treatment and control groups.     Proportion who had a stroke in the treatment (stent) group: .    Proportion who had a stroke in the control group: .     These two summary statistics are useful in looking for differences in the groups, and we are in for a surprise: an additional 8% of patients in the treatment group had a stroke! This is important for two reasons. First, it is contrary to what doctors expected, which was that stents would reduce the rate of strokes. Second, it leads to a statistical question: do the data show a real difference between the groups?  This second question is subtle. Suppose you flip a coin 100 times. While the chance a coin lands heads in any given coin flip is 50%, we probably won't observe exactly 50 heads. This type of fluctuation is part of almost any type of data generating process. It is possible that the 8% difference in the stent study is due to this natural variation. However, the larger the difference we observe (for a particular sample size), the less believable it is that the difference is due to chance. So what we are really asking is the following: is the difference so large that we should reject the notion that it was due to chance?  While we don't yet have our statistical tools to fully address this question on our own, we can comprehend the conclusions of the published analysis: there was compelling evidence of harm by stents in this study of stroke patients.   Be careful  Do not generalize the results of this study to all patients and all stents. This study looked at patients with very specific characteristics who volunteered to be a part of this study and who may not be representative of all stroke patients. In addition, there are many types of stents and this study only considered the self-expanding Wingspan stent (Boston Scientific). However, this study does leave us with an important lesson: we should keep our eyes open for surprises.    Exercises  Migraine and acupuncture, Part I  A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the contingency table below.

What percent were pain free in the control group?    In which group did a higher percent of patients become pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture?    Your findings so far might suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines for all people who suffer from migraines. However, this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients that are pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture in the two groups?      Sinusitis and antibiotics, Part I  Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to one of two groups: treatment or control. Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. At the end of the 10-day period, patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms. The distribution of responses is summarized below.

Your findings so far might suggest a real difference in effectiveness of antibiotic and placebo treatments for improving symptoms of sinusitis. However, this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients in the antibiotic and placebo treatment groups that experience improvement in symptoms of sinusitis?

  "title": "Data basics",
  "body": " Data basics   Effective organization and description of data is a first step in most analyses. This section introduces the data matrix for organizing data as well as some terminology about different forms of data that will be used throughout this book.    Observations, variables, and data matrices  loan50 data   displays rows 1, 2, 3, and 50 of a data set for 50 randomly sampled loans offered through Lending Club, which is a peer-to-peer lending company. These observations will be referred to as the loan50 data set.  Each row in the table represents a single loan. The formal name for a row is a case or observational unit . The columns represent characteristics, called variables , for each of the loans. For example, the first row represents a loan of $22,000 with an interest rate of 10.90%, where the borrower is based in New Jersey (NJ) and has an income of $59,000.   Four rows from the loan50 data matrix     loan_amount  interest_rate  term  grade  state  total_income  homeownership    1  22000  10.90  60.00  B  NJ  59000.00  rent    2  6000  9.92  36.00  B  CA  60000.00  rent    3  25000  26.30  36.00  E  SC  75000.00  mortgage              50  15000  6.08  36.00  A  TX  77500.00  mortgage     Reading data from a data matrix  What is the grade of the first loan in ? And what is the home ownership status of the borrower for that first loan?   The loan's grade is B, and the borrower rents their residence.   In practice, it is especially important to ask clarifying questions to ensure important aspects of the data are understood. For instance, it is always important to be sure we know what each variable means and the units of measurement. Descriptions of the loan50 variables are given in .   Variables and their descriptions for the loan50 data set      variable  description    loan_amount  Amount of the loan received, in US dollars.    interest_rate  Interest rate on the loan, in an annual percentage.    term  The length of the loan, which is always set as a whole number of months.    grade  Loan grade, which takes values A through G and represents the quality of the loan and its likelihood of being repaid.    state  US state where the borrower resides.    total_income  Borrower's total income, including any second income, in US dollars.    homeownership  Indicates whether the person owns, owns but has a mortgage, or rents.     The data in represent a data matrix , which is a convenient and common way to organize data, especially if collecting data in a spreadsheet. Each row of a data matrix corresponds to a unique case (observational unit), and each column corresponds to a variable.  When recording data, use a data matrix unless you have a very good reason to use a different structure. This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables as new columns.  Organizing a gradebook  The grades for assignments, quizzes, and exams in a course are often recorded in a gradebook that takes the form of a data matrix. How might you organize grade data using a data matrix?   There are multiple strategies that can be followed. One common strategy is to have each student represented by a row, and then add a column for each assignment, quiz, or exam. Under this setup, it is easy to review a single line to understand a student's grade history. There should also be columns to include student information, such as one column to list student names.    county data We consider data for 3,142 counties in the United States. The data includes each county's name, the state where it resides, its population in 2017, how its population changed from 2010 to 2017, poverty rate, and six additional characteristics.  Organizing county data  How might the county data described above be organized in a data matrix?   Each county may be viewed as a case, and there are eleven pieces of information recorded for each case. A table with 3,142 rows and 11 columns could hold these data, where each row represents a county and each column represents a particular piece of information.     Types of variables  Examine the unemp_rate , pop , state , and median_edu variables in the county data set. Each of these variables is inherently different from the other three, yet some share certain characteristics.  First consider unemp_rate , which is said to be a numerical variable since it can take a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add, subtract, or take averages with those values. On the other hand, we would not classify a variable reporting telephone area codes as numerical since the average, sum, and difference of area codes doesn't have any clear meaning.  The pop variable is also numerical, although it seems to be a little different than unemp_rate . This variable of the population count can only take whole non-negative numbers (0, 1, 2, ). For this reason, the population variable is said to be discrete since it can only take numerical values with jumps. On the other hand, the unemployment rate variable is said to be continuous .  The variable state can take up to 51 values after accounting for Washington, DC: AL, AK, , and WY. Because the responses themselves are categories, state is called a categorical variable, and the possible values are called the variable's levels .  Finally, consider the median_edu variable, which describes the median education level of county residents and takes values below_hs , hs_diploma , some_college , or bachelors in each county. This variable seems to be a hybrid: it is a categorical variable but the levels have a natural ordering. A variable with these properties is called an ordinal variable, while a regular categorical variable without this type of special ordering is called a nominal variable. To simplify analyses, any ordinal variable in this book will be treated as a nominal (unordered) categorical variable.   Breakdown of variables into their respective types   A tree diagram showing \"all variables\" at the top, branching into \"numeric\" and \"categorical\". The \"numeric\" branch splits into \"continuous\" and \"discrete\", while the \"categorical\" branch splits into \"nominal (unordered categorical)\" and \"ordinal (ordered categorical)\".     Classifying variables by type   Data were collected about students in a statistics course. Three variables were recorded for each student: number of siblings, student height, and whether the student had previously taken a statistics course. Classify each of the variables as continuous numerical, discrete numerical, or categorical.    The number of siblings and student height represent numerical variables. Because the number of siblings is a count, it is discrete. Height varies continuously, so it is a continuous numerical variable. The last variable classifies students into two categories those who have and those who have not taken a statistics course which makes this variable categorical.    Classifying experiment variables  An experiment is evaluating the effectiveness of a new drug in treating migraines. A group variable is used to indicate the experiment group for each patient: treatment or control. The num_migraines variable represents the number of migraines the patient experienced during a 3-month period. Classify each variable as either numerical or categorical.   The group variable can take just one of two group names, making it categorical. The num_migraines variable describes a count of the number of migraines, which is an outcome where basic arithmetic is sensible, which means this is numerical outcome; more specifically, since it represents a count, num_migraines is a discrete numerical variable.     Relationships between variables  Many analyses are motivated by a researcher looking for a relationship between two or more variables. A social scientist may like to answer some of the following questions:     If homeownership is lower than the national average in one county, will the percent of multi-unit structures in that county tend to be above or below the national average?    Does a higher than average increase in county population tend to correspond to counties with higher or lower median household incomes?    How useful a predictor is median education level for the median household income for US counties?     To answer these questions, data must be collected, such as the county data set. Examining summary statistics could provide insights for each of the three questions about counties. Additionally, graphs can be used to visually explore data.   Scatterplots are one type of graph used to study the relationship between two numerical variables. A scatterplot comparing the variables homeownership and multi_unit (the percent of units in multi-unit structures such as apartments and condos) shows that counties with a higher rate of multi-units tend to have lower homeownership rates. We might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and investigate each idea to determine which are the most reasonable explanations.  The multi-unit and homeownership rates are said to be associated because the plot shows a discernible pattern. When two variables show some connection with one another, they are called associated variables. Associated variables can also be called dependent variables and vice-versa.    Exercises  Air pollution and birth outcomes, study components  Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM 10 and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.   Identify the main research question of the study.  Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?  What are the variables in the study? Identify each variable as numerical or categorical. If numerical, state whether the variable is discrete or continuous. If categorical, state whether the variable is ordinal.    Buteyko method, study components  The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These patients were randomly split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.   Identify the main research question of the study.  Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?  What are the variables in the study? Identify each variable as numerical or categorical. If numerical, state whether the variable is discrete or continuous. If categorical, state whether the variable is ordinal.    Cheaters, study components  Researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15. Participants reported their age, sex, and whether they were an only child or not. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they would only reward children who report white. The study found differences in cheating rates based on instructions and characteristics.   Identify the main research question of the study.  Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?  How many variables were recorded for each subject in the study in order to conclude these findings? State the variables and their types.    Stealers, study components  In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior, 129 University of California undergraduates at Berkeley were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money, most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs. They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. After completing some unrelated tasks, participants reported the number of candies they had taken. It was found that those who were identified as upper-class took more candy than others.   Identify the main research question of the study.  Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?  The study found that students who were identified as upper-class took more candy than others. How many variables were recorded for each subject in the study in order to conclude these findings? State the variables and their types.    Relaxing after work  The General Social Survey asked the question, “After an average work day, about how many hours do you have to relax or pursue activities that you enjoy?” to a random sample of 1,155 Americans. The average relaxing time was found to be 1.65 hours. Determine which of the following is an observation, a variable, a sample statistic, or a population parameter.   An American in the sample.  Number of hours spent relaxing after an average work day.  1.65.  Average number of hours all Americans spend relaxing after an average work day.    Cats on YouTube  Suppose you want to estimate the percentage of videos on YouTube that are cat videos. It is impossible for you to watch all videos on YouTube so you use a random video picker to select 1000 videos for you. You find that 2% of these videos are cat videos. Determine which of the following is an observation, a variable, a sample statistic, or a population parameter.   Percentage of all videos on YouTube that are cat videos.  2%.  A video in your sample.  Whether or not a video is a cat video.    Course satisfaction across sections  A large college class has 160 students. All 160 students attend the lectures together, but the students are divided into 4 groups, each of 40 students, for lab sections administered by different teaching assistants. The professor wants to conduct a survey about how satisfied the students are with the course, and he believes that the lab section a student is in might affect the student's overall satisfaction with the course.   What type of study is this?  Suggest a sampling strategy for carrying out this study.    Housing proposal across dorms  On a large college campus first-year students and sophomores live in dorms located on the eastern part of the campus and juniors and seniors live in dorms located on the western part of the campus. Suppose you want to collect student opinions on a new housing structure the college administration is proposing and you want to make sure your survey equally represents opinions from students from all years.   What type of study is this?  Suggest a sampling strategy for carrying out this study.    Internet use and life expectancy  A study evaluated the relationship between estimated life expectancy at birth (as of 2014) and percentage of internet users (as of 2009) in 208 countries. A scatterplot shows life expectancy versus percent internet users.   Describe the relationship between life expectancy and percentage of internet users.  What type of study is this?  State a possible confounding variable that might explain this relationship and describe its potential effect.    Life expectancy versus internet use   Scatterplot of life expectancy at birth versus percent internet users for 208 countries.     Stressed out, Part I  A study surveyed a random sample of otherwise healthy high school students and found that they are more likely to get muscle cramps when they are stressed. The study also noted that students drink more coffee and sleep less when they are stressed.   What type of study is this?  Can this study be used to conclude a causal relationship between increased stress and muscle cramps?  State possible confounding variables that might explain the observed relationship between increased stress and muscle cramps.    Evaluate sampling methods  A university wants to determine what fraction of its undergraduate student body support a new $25 annual fee to improve the student union. For each proposed method below, indicate whether the method is reasonable or not.   Survey a simple random sample of 500 students.  Stratify students by their field of study, then sample 10% of students from each stratum.  Cluster students by their ages (e.g. 18 years old in one cluster, 19 years old in one cluster, etc.), then randomly sample three clusters and survey all students in those clusters.    Random digit dialing  The Gallup Poll uses a procedure called random digit dialing, which creates phone numbers based on a list of all area codes in America in conjunction with the associated number of residential households in each area code. Give a possible reason the Gallup Poll chooses to use random digit dialing instead of picking phone numbers from the phone book.   Haters are gonna hate, study confirms  A study asked a group of 200 randomly sampled men and women to evaluate how they felt about various subjects to measure their attitude towards mostly independent stimuli, then presented information about a fictitious microwave oven. People who reacted positively to the subjects also tended to react positively to the microwave oven, and those who reacted negatively tended to react negatively to it.   What are the cases?  What are the response variables?  What are the explanatory variables?  Does the study employ random sampling?  Is this an observational study or an experiment? Explain.  Can we establish a causal link between the explanatory and response variables?  Can the results of the study be generalized to the population at large?    Family size  Suppose we want to estimate household size. If we select students at random at an elementary school and ask them what their family size is, will this be a good measure of household size? Or will our average be biased? If so, will it overestimate or underestimate the true value?   Sampling strategies  A statistics student curious about the relationship between the amount of time students spend on social networking sites and their performance at school considers several sampling strategies. For each, name the sampling method proposed and any bias you might expect.   Randomly sample 40 students from the population, give them the survey, ask them to return it the next day.  Give out the survey only to friends, making sure each one fills it out.  Post a link to an online survey on Facebook and ask friends to fill it out.  Randomly sample 5 classes and ask a random sample of students from those classes to fill out the survey.    Reading the paper  Consider two news excerpts, one about smoking and dementia, and another about sleep disorders and bullying. For each, evaluate whether the conclusions are justified and what can actually be concluded from the studies described.   Researchers analyzed data on over 23,000 people aged 50-60 and found smokers were more likely to develop dementia. Can we conclude smoking causes dementia later in life? Explain.  A study collected survey data on children’s sleep habits and bullying behavior and found those with sleep problems were twice as likely to have disruptive behavior or bullying issues. Does this show sleep disorders lead to bullying? If not, how best to describe the conclusion?    Migraine and acupuncture, Part II  A randomized controlled study assigned migraine patients to acupuncture designed for migraines (treatment) or placebo acupuncture (control). Twenty-four hours later, patients reported whether they were pain free. Identify the explanatory and response variables.   Sinusitis and antibiotics, Part II  A study on acute sinusitis compared a 10-day antibiotic course (treatment) to a placebo (control), then asked patients if they experienced improvement in symptoms. Identify the explanatory and response variables.   Fisher’s irises  A data set contains sepal length and width, and petal length and width from three species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica), with 50 flowers from each species.   How many cases are included?  How many numerical variables are included? Identify each and whether it is continuous or discrete.  How many categorical variables are included? List them and their levels.    Iris versicolor   Photo of a purple iris flower.     Smoking habits of UK residents  A survey was conducted to study the smoking habits of UK residents. A portion of the data matrix is shown with variables: sex, age, marital status, gross income, smoking status, and cigarettes per day on weekends and weekdays.   Subset of UK smoking survey    sex age marital grossIncome smoke amtWeekends amtWeekdays   1 Female 42 Single Under GBP 2,600 Yes 12 cig\/day 12 cig\/day  2 Male 44 Single GBP 10,400 to GBP 15,600 No N\/A N\/A  3 Male 53 Married Above GBP 36,400 Yes 6 cig\/day 6 cig\/day   1691 Male 40 Single GBP 2,600 to GBP 5,200 Yes 8 cig\/day 8 cig\/day     What does each row of the data matrix represent?

  "title": "Sampling principles and strategies",
  "body": " Sampling principles and strategies   The first step in research is to pose a clear question, then decide what subjects to study and how to collect reliable data. Careful sampling is essential for trustworthy conclusions.    Populations and samples  Each research question targets a population. Often it is too expensive to measure every case, so we select a sample—a subset of the population—to estimate the quantity of interest.   Identifying populations   Consider: (1) the average mercury content in Atlantic swordfish, (2) the average time to degree for Duke undergrads in the last 5 years, (3) whether a new drug reduces deaths in patients with severe heart disease. Each has a population and cases; samples are used to estimate population features.    Identifying populations  For questions (2) and (3) above, identify the target population and what represents a single case.   Graduated Duke undergrads in the last five years; each graduate is a case. People with severe heart disease; each patient is a case.     Anecdotal evidence  Conclusions based on a few striking cases—anecdotal evidence—may not represent the population. Such cases are memorable but rarely typical.   Anecdotal evidence can mislead   Snowy trees after a storm; one storm in one region says little about global climate.     Be cautious with anecdotal evidence: it may be true but not representative.     Sampling from a population  We typically use a random sample to avoid bias. In a simple random sample each case has equal chance of selection and selection of one case gives no information about others.   Selecting a random sample   Randomly selecting cases from a population to form a sample.     Unintentional bias   Letting a nutrition major hand-pick graduates might overrepresent health-related fields. Hand selection risks bias even when unintended.     Biased selection   Sampling only from a subset (e.g., health-related majors) introduces bias.    Non-response can also bias results: if only a fraction respond, the sample may not represent the population.   Effect of non-response   Surveys may only capture a subset of the intended population.    Interpreting online reviews  Product ratings online come from those who choose to post. If 50% of reviews are negative, does that imply 50% of buyers are dissatisfied?   Likely not; reviewers are self-selected and may be more motivated when dissatisfied, creating negative bias.     Observational studies  Observational data arise without assigning treatments. They can show association but cannot alone establish causation due to possible confounding variables.  Sunscreen and skin cancer  Suppose an observational study finds sunscreen use associated with higher skin cancer. Does sunscreen cause cancer?   No. Sun exposure confounds: more sun leads to both more sunscreen and higher cancer risk.   Confounding variables affect both explanatory and response variables. Observational studies may be prospective (following subjects forward) or retrospective (using past records).    Four sampling methods  Randomness underlies most statistical methods. Common designs:   Simple random sample: every case equally likely, independent selection.  Stratified sample: divide into similar strata, then sample within each.  Cluster sample: divide into clusters, sample clusters, include all cases in chosen clusters.  Multistage sample: sample clusters, then sample within clusters.    Simple random vs. stratified sampling   Comparison of selecting individuals directly versus sampling within strata.     Cluster and multistage sampling   Sampling entire clusters or sampling within selected clusters.     Choosing a sampling design   Estimating malaria rate across 30 similar villages: cluster or multistage sampling (select villages, then people) is cost-effective and yields reliable estimates with appropriate analysis.      Exercises   Air pollution and birth outcomes, scope of inference  For the air pollution and preterm births study: identify population and sample; discuss generalizability and causality.   Cheaters, scope of inference  For the honesty study on 160 children: identify population and sample; discuss generalizability and causality.   Buteyko method, scope of inference  For the Buteyko asthma study: identify population and sample; discuss generalizability and causality.   Stealers, scope of inference  For the socio-economic class and candy study: identify population and sample; discuss generalizability and causality.   Relaxing after work  Classify observation, variable, statistic, parameter for the relaxing time survey (mean 1.65 hours).   Cats on YouTube  Classify observation, variable, statistic, parameter for estimating percent cat videos.   Course satisfaction across sections  Large class with four lab sections: identify study type and propose sampling strategy.   Housing proposal across dorms  Survey opinions across east\/west campus dorms ensuring equal year representation: identify study type and sampling plan.   Internet use and life expectancy  Interpret the life expectancy vs. internet use scatterplot; identify study type and a confounder.   Stressed out, Part I  Stress and muscle cramps observational study: study type, causality, possible confounders.   Evaluate sampling methods  Assess reasonableness of three proposed sampling designs for a student fee survey.   Random digit dialing  Why Gallup uses random digit dialing instead of the phone book.   Haters are gonna hate, study confirms  Dispositional attitude study with fake microwave reviews: identify cases, variables, sampling, design, causality, generalization.   Family size  Surveying elementary students about family size: is the estimate biased and in which direction?   Sampling strategies  Classify four proposed sampling methods for a social networking survey and discuss bias.   Reading the paper  Evaluate conclusions in two news articles: smoking and dementia; sleep disorders and bullying.    "

Principles of experimental design  Four core principles:   Controlling: hold other factors constant across groups.  Randomization: randomly assign cases to treatments to balance unmeasured factors.  Replication: use enough cases (and replicate studies) to estimate effects precisely.  Blocking: when a known factor affects the response, group by that factor and randomize within blocks.    Blocking on patient risk   Patients split into low\/high risk blocks, then randomized within blocks to control and treatment.      Reducing bias in human experiments  To avoid placebo and observer effects, patients are blinded to treatment via placebos; double-blind designs also blind caregivers\/researchers interacting with patients.  Blinding in the stent study  Was the stent study an experiment? Was it blind or double-blind?   It was an experiment (researchers assigned treatments). It was not blind, so not double-blind.   Placebos via sham surgery  Could the stent study have used a placebo? What would it look like?   A sham surgery—performing surgical steps without implanting the stent—could serve as a placebo, though with ethical considerations.     Exercises  Light and exam performance  Design: compare lighting types on exam performance, blocking by sex. Identify response, explanatory variable (with levels), and blocking variable.

  "title": "Case study: Malaria vaccine",
  "body": " Case study: Malaria vaccine   Left vs. right side ownership   Suppose students in class are split into left and right sides. Let $\\hat p_L$ and $\\hat p_R$ be the proportions owning an Apple product on each side. Would it be surprising if $\\hat p_L$ were not exactly equal to $\\hat p_R$?    They would likely be close but not exactly equal; small differences are expected by chance.    Independence assumption  If seating side and Apple ownership are unrelated, what assumption are we making about these variables?   We assume the variables are independent.    Variability within data  A clinical study tested a malaria vaccine (PfSPZ). Fourteen patients were randomized to receive the vaccine and six to a placebo. Nineteen weeks later all 20 were exposed to a drug-sensitive parasite strain so any infections could be treated effectively. Nine of the 14 vaccinated patients showed no infection, while all six placebo patients showed baseline signs of infection.   Summary results for the malaria vaccine experiment     Outcome  Infection  No infection    Vaccine  5  9  14    Placebo  6  0  6    Total  11  9  20     Study type  Is this an observational study or an experiment? What does that imply about causal conclusions?   It is an experiment (random assignment). Causal conclusions about the vaccine’s effect are appropriate.    What counts as convincing?   The observed infection rates were 35.7% for vaccine vs. 100% for placebo. Does this provide convincing evidence the vaccine works?    The large difference suggests effectiveness, but the small sample means the difference could be due to chance. We need to evaluate how likely such a gap is under no effect.    We compare two competing claims:   Independence model ( ): Treatment and outcome are independent; the 64.3% difference in infection rates arose by chance.  Alternative model ( ): Treatment and outcome are not independent; the vaccine affected infection rates.   If is true, 11 patients would be infected and 9 uninfected regardless of assignment, so any difference is random. If is true, we expect some real difference between groups.    Simulating the study  Assume the vaccine has no effect. To gauge how unusual the observed difference is, simulate new random assignments: write “infection” on 11 cards and “no infection” on 9 cards, shuffle, deal 14 to vaccine and 6 to placebo, and tabulate infection counts.   Simulation results under independence (one shuffle)     Outcome  Infection  No infection    Vaccine (sim.)  7  7  14    Placebo (sim.)  4  2  6    Total  11  9  20     Difference in a simulation  Compute the infection-rate difference for the simulation above (placebo minus vaccine). How does it compare to the observed 64.3% gap?   Difference is $4\/6 - 7\/14 \\approx 0.167$ (16.7%), much smaller than the observed 64.3% gap.     Checking for independence  Repeat the randomization many times by computer. The simulated differences (placebo rate minus vaccine rate) form a distribution centered near 0. Figure shows 100 simulations.   Differences from 100 simulations under independence.   Stacked dot plot of simulated infection-rate differences; only two simulations reach the observed 64.3% difference.     How rare is 64.3%?   According to the simulations, how often does a difference of at least 64.3% occur?    About 2% of simulations reach that difference—rare under independence.    The rare occurrence of such a large difference leaves two options:   : Vaccine has no effect and we observed a rare chance event.  : Vaccine reduces infections; the observed difference reflects efficacy.   In formal studies we typically reject when faced with such rare outcomes. Here we conclude the data provide strong evidence the vaccine offers protection in this clinical setting.

What proportion of all patients had cardiovascular problems?  If treatment and outcome were independent, expected rosiglitazone problems?  A randomization simulation produced a histogram of rosiglitazone problem counts. Use it to identify claims, direction supporting $H_A$, and what the simulation suggests.    Heart transplants  Stanford heart-transplant program: control 34 patients (30 died), treatment 69 (45 died).
