  "title": "Case study: using stents to prevent strokes",
  "body": " Case study: using stents to prevent strokes  stroke   This section introduces a classic challenge in statistics: evaluating the efficacy of a medical treatment. Terms in this section, and indeed much of this chapter, will all be revisited later in the text. The plan for now is simply to get a sense of the role statistics can play in practice.  In this section we will consider an experiment that studies effectiveness of stents in treating patients at risk of stroke. Stents are devices put inside blood vessels that assist in patient recovery after cardiac events and reduce the risk of an additional heart attack or death. Many doctors have hoped that there would be similar benefits for patients at risk of stroke. We start by writing the principal question the researchers hope to answer:   Does the use of stents reduce the risk of stroke?   The researchers who asked this question conducted an experiment with 451 at-risk patients. Each volunteer patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups:      Treatment group . Patients in the treatment group received a stent and medical management. The medical management included medications, management of risk factors, and help in lifestyle modification.     Control group . Patients in the control group received the same medical management as the treatment group, but they did not receive stents.     Researchers randomly assigned 224 patients to the treatment group and 227 to the control group. In this study, the control group provides a reference point against which we can measure the medical impact of stents in the treatment group.  Researchers studied the effect of stents at two time points: 30 days after enrollment and 365 days after enrollment. The results of 5 patients are summarized in . Patient outcomes are recorded as stroke or no event , representing whether or not the patient had a stroke at the end of a time period.    Results for five patients from the stent study    Patient  group  0-30 days  0-365 days    1  treatment  no event  no event    2  treatment  stroke  stroke    3  treatment  no event  no event          450  control  no event  no event    451  control  no event  no event     Considering data from each patient individually would be a long, cumbersome path towards answering the original research question. Instead, performing a statistical data analysis allows us to consider all of the data at once. summarizes the raw data in a more helpful way. In this table, we can quickly see what happened over the entire study. For instance, to identify the number of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke within 30 days, we look on the left-side of the table at the intersection of the treatment and stroke: 33.   Descriptive statistics for the stent study     0-30 days   0-365 days     stroke  no event   stroke  no event    treatment  33  191   45  179    control  13  214   28  199    Total  46  405   73  378      Computing proportions from the stent study   Of the 224 patients in the treatment group, 45 had a stroke by the end of the first year. Using these two numbers, compute the proportion of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke by the end of their first year.    The proportion of the 224 patients who had a stroke within 365 days: .    We can compute summary statistics from the table. A summary statistic is a single number summarizing a large amount of data. For instance, the primary results of the study after 1 year could be described by two summary statistics: the proportion of people who had a stroke in the treatment and control groups.     Proportion who had a stroke in the treatment (stent) group: .    Proportion who had a stroke in the control group: .     These two summary statistics are useful in looking for differences in the groups, and we are in for a surprise: an additional 8% of patients in the treatment group had a stroke! This is important for two reasons. First, it is contrary to what doctors expected, which was that stents would reduce the rate of strokes. Second, it leads to a statistical question: do the data show a real difference between the groups?  This second question is subtle. Suppose you flip a coin 100 times. While the chance a coin lands heads in any given coin flip is 50%, we probably won't observe exactly 50 heads. This type of fluctuation is part of almost any type of data generating process. It is possible that the 8% difference in the stent study is due to this natural variation. However, the larger the difference we observe (for a particular sample size), the less believable it is that the difference is due to chance. So what we are really asking is the following: is the difference so large that we should reject the notion that it was due to chance?  While we don't yet have our statistical tools to fully address this question on our own, we can comprehend the conclusions of the published analysis: there was compelling evidence of harm by stents in this study of stroke patients.   Be careful  Do not generalize the results of this study to all patients and all stents. This study looked at patients with very specific characteristics who volunteered to be a part of this study and who may not be representative of all stroke patients. In addition, there are many types of stents and this study only considered the self-expanding Wingspan stent (Boston Scientific). However, this study does leave us with an important lesson: we should keep our eyes open for surprises.    Exercises   Migraine and acupuncture, Part I   A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the contingency table below.

What percent were pain free in the control group?    In which group did a higher percent of patients become pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture?    Your findings so far might suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines for all people who suffer from migraines. However, this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients that are pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture in the two groups?        Sinusitis and antibiotics, Part I   Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to one of two groups: treatment or control. Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. At the end of the 10-day period, patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms. The distribution of responses is summarized below.

However, this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far.

  "body": " Data basics   Effective organization and description of data is a first step in most analyses. This section introduces the data matrix for organizing data as well as some terminology about different forms of data that will be used throughout this book.    Observations, variables, and data matrices  loan50 data   displays rows 1, 2, 3, and 50 of a data set for 50 randomly sampled loans offered through Lending Club, which is a peer-to-peer lending company. These observations will be referred to as the loan50 data set.  Each row in the table represents a single loan. The formal name for a row is a case or observational unit . The columns represent characteristics, called variables , for each of the loans. For example, the first row represents a loan of $22,000 with an interest rate of 10.90%, where the borrower is based in New Jersey (NJ) and has an income of $59,000.   Four rows from the loan50 data matrix     loan_amount  interest_rate  term  grade  state  total_income  homeownership    1  22000  10.90  60.00  B  NJ  59000.00  rent    2  6000  9.92  36.00  B  CA  60000.00  rent    3  25000  26.30  36.00  E  SC  75000.00  mortgage              50  15000  6.08  36.00  A  TX  77500.00  mortgage      Reading data from a data matrix   What is the grade of the first loan in ? And what is the home ownership status of the borrower for that first loan?    The loan's grade is B, and the borrower rents their residence.    In practice, it is especially important to ask clarifying questions to ensure important aspects of the data are understood. For instance, it is always important to be sure we know what each variable means and the units of measurement. Descriptions of the loan50 variables are given in .   Variables and their descriptions for the loan50 data set      variable  description    loan_amount  Amount of the loan received, in US dollars.    interest_rate  Interest rate on the loan, in an annual percentage.    term  The length of the loan, which is always set as a whole number of months.    grade  Loan grade, which takes values A through G and represents the quality of the loan and its likelihood of being repaid.    state  US state where the borrower resides.    total_income  Borrower's total income, including any second income, in US dollars.    homeownership  Indicates whether the person owns, owns but has a mortgage, or rents.     The data in represent a data matrix , which is a convenient and common way to organize data, especially if collecting data in a spreadsheet. Each row of a data matrix corresponds to a unique case (observational unit), and each column corresponds to a variable.  When recording data, use a data matrix unless you have a very good reason to use a different structure. This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables as new columns.   Organizing a gradebook   The grades for assignments, quizzes, and exams in a course are often recorded in a gradebook that takes the form of a data matrix. How might you organize grade data using a data matrix?    There are multiple strategies that can be followed. One common strategy is to have each student represented by a row, and then add a column for each assignment, quiz, or exam. Under this setup, it is easy to review a single line to understand a student's grade history. There should also be columns to include student information, such as one column to list student names.     Organizing county data    county data We consider data for 3,142 counties in the United States. The data includes each county's name, the state where it resides, its population in 2017, how its population changed from 2010 to 2017, poverty rate, and six additional characteristics. How might the county data described above be organized in a data matrix?    Each county may be viewed as a case, and there are eleven pieces of information recorded for each case. A table with 3,142 rows and 11 columns could hold these data, where each row represents a county and each column represents a particular piece of information.    The data described in Guided Practice about the county data represents the county data set, which is shown as a data matrix in and with variable descriptions in .

For example, the value 1.48 in the first row means the population for this county increased by 1.48% from 2010 to 2017.    poverty  Percent of the population in poverty.    homeownership  Percent of the population that lives in their own home or lives with the owner, e.g. children living with parents who own the home.    multi_unit  Percent of living units that are in multi-unit structures, e.g. apartments.    unemp_rate  Unemployment rate as a percent.    metro  Whether the county contains a metropolitan area.    median_edu  Median education level, which can take a value among below_hs, hs_diploma, some_college, and bachelors.    median_hh_income  Median household income for the county, where a household's income equals the total income of its occupants who are 15 years or older.       Types of variables  Examine the unemp_rate , pop , state , and median_edu variables in the county data set. Each of these variables is inherently different from the other three, yet some share certain characteristics.  First consider unemp_rate , which is said to be a numerical variable since it can take a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add, subtract, or take averages with those values. On the other hand, we would not classify a variable reporting telephone area codes as numerical since the average, sum, and difference of area codes doesn't have any clear meaning.  The pop variable is also numerical, although it seems to be a little different than unemp_rate . This variable of the population count can only take whole non-negative numbers (0, 1, 2, ). For this reason, the population variable is said to be discrete since it can only take numerical values with jumps. On the other hand, the unemployment rate variable is said to be continuous .  The variable state can take up to 51 values after accounting for Washington, DC: AL, AK, , and WY. Because the responses themselves are categories, state is called a categorical variable, and the possible values are called the variable's levels .  Finally, consider the median_edu variable, which describes the median education level of county residents and takes values below_hs , hs_diploma , some_college , or bachelors in each county. This variable seems to be a hybrid: it is a categorical variable but the levels have a natural ordering. A variable with these properties is called an ordinal variable, while a regular categorical variable without this type of special ordering is called a nominal variable. To simplify analyses, any ordinal variable in this book will be treated as a nominal (unordered) categorical variable.   Breakdown of variables into their respective types   A tree diagram showing \"all variables\" at the top, branching into \"numeric\" and \"categorical\". The \"numeric\" branch splits into \"continuous\" and \"discrete\", while the \"categorical\" branch splits into \"nominal (unordered categorical)\" and \"ordinal (ordered categorical)\".     Classifying variables by type   Data were collected about students in a statistics course. Three variables were recorded for each student: number of siblings, student height, and whether the student had previously taken a statistics course. Classify each of the variables as continuous numerical, discrete numerical, or categorical.    The number of siblings and student height represent numerical variables. Because the number of siblings is a count, it is discrete. Height varies continuously, so it is a continuous numerical variable. The last variable classifies students into two categories those who have and those who have not taken a statistics course which makes this variable categorical.     Classifying experiment variables   An experiment is evaluating the effectiveness of a new drug in treating migraines. A group variable is used to indicate the experiment group for each patient: treatment or control. The num_migraines variable represents the number of migraines the patient experienced during a 3-month period. Classify each variable as either numerical or categorical.    The group variable can take just one of two group names, making it categorical. The num_migraines variable describes a count of the number of migraines, which is an outcome where basic arithmetic is sensible, which means this is numerical outcome; more specifically, since it represents a count, num_migraines is a discrete numerical variable.      Relationships between variables  Many analyses are motivated by a researcher looking for a relationship between two or more variables. A social scientist may like to answer some of the following questions:     If homeownership is lower than the national average in one county, will the percent of multi-unit structures in that county tend to be above or below the national average?    Does a higher than average increase in county population tend to correspond to counties with higher or lower median household incomes?    How useful a predictor is median education level for the median household income for US counties?     To answer these questions, data must be collected, such as the county data set. Examining summary statistics could provide insights for each of the three questions about counties. Additionally, graphs can be used to visually explore data.   Scatterplots are one type of graph used to study the relationship between two numerical variables. compares the variables homeownership and multi_unit , which is the percent of units in multi-unit structures (e.g. apartments, condos). Each point on the plot represents a single county. For instance, the highlighted dot corresponds to County 413 in the county data set: Chattahoochee County, Georgia, which has 39.4% of units in multi-unit structures and a homeownership rate of 31.3%. The scatterplot suggests a relationship between the two variables: counties with a higher rate of multi-units tend to have lower homeownership rates. We might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and investigate each idea to determine which are the most reasonable explanations.   A scatterplot of homeownership versus the percent of units that are in multi-unit structures for US counties. The highlighted dot represents Chattahoochee County, Georgia, which has a multi-unit rate of 39.4% and a homeownership rate of 31.3%.   Scatterplot of thousands of counties with the percent of multiunit structures in each county shown on the horizontal axis and homeownership rate shown on the vertical axis. The data range from 0% to almost 100% for both variables. In general, the points are much more concentrated in the upper left corner of the graph and then trend downward for observations further to the right while also becoming more sparse. One point is annotated at the location (39.4%, 31.3%).    The multi-unit and homeownership rates are said to be associated because the plot shows a discernible pattern. When two variables show some connection with one another, they are called associated variables. Associated variables can also be called dependent variables and vice-versa.   Creating research questions   Examine the variables in the loan50 data set. Create two questions about possible relationships between variables in loan50 that are of interest to you.    Two example questions: (1) What is the relationship between loan amount and total income? (2) If someone's income is above the average, will their interest rate tend to be above or below the average?     Examining relationship between population change and income   This example examines the relationship between a county's population change from 2010 to 2017 and median household income, which is visualized as a scatterplot in . Are these variables associated?    The larger the median household income for a county, the higher the population growth observed for the county. While this trend isn't true for every county, the trend in the plot is evident. Since there is some relationship between the variables, they are associated.     A scatterplot showing pop_change against median_hh_income . Owsley County of Kentucky is highlighted, which lost 3.63% of its population from 2010 to 2017 and had median household income of $22,736.   Scatterplot of thousands of counties with the median household income along the horizontal axis (data ranging from $0 to $120,000) and population change over 7 years (data ranging from about -15% to 25%). There is a cloud of points centered around ($45,000, -1%), and the points show a slight trend upwards while also becoming more sparse and volatile for observations corresponding to higher median incomes. One point is annotated at the location ($22,736, -3.63%).    Because there is a downward trend in  counties with more units in multi-unit structures are associated with lower homeownership these variables are said to be negatively associated . A positive association is shown in the relationship between the median_hh_income and pop_change in , where counties with higher median household income tend to have higher rates of population growth.  If two variables are not associated, then they are said to be independent . That is, two variables are independent if there is no evident relationship between the two.   Associated or independent, not both  A pair of variables are either related in some way (associated) or not (independent). No pair of variables is both associated and independent.     Explanatory and response variables  When we ask questions about the relationship between two variables, we sometimes also want to determine if the change in one variable causes a change in the other. Consider the following rephrasing of an earlier question about the county data set:    If there is an increase in the median household income in a county, does this drive an increase in its population?    In this question, we are asking whether one variable affects another. If this is our underlying belief, then median household income is the explanatory variable and the population change is the response variable in the hypothesized relationship. Sometimes the explanatory variable is called the independent variable and the response variable is called the dependent variable . However, this becomes confusing since a pair of variables might be independent or dependent, so we avoid this language.    Explanatory and response variables  When we suspect one variable might causally affect another, we label the first variable the explanatory variable and the second the response variable .  For many pairs of variables, there is no hypothesized relationship, and these labels would not be applied to either variable in such cases.   Bear in mind that the act of labeling the variables in this way does nothing to ensure that a causal relationship exists. A formal evaluation to check whether one variable causes a change in another requires an experiment.    Introducing observational studies and experiments  There are two primary types of data collection: observational studies and experiments.  Researchers perform an observational study when they collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise. For instance, researchers may collect information via surveys, review medical records, or follow a cohort of many similar individuals to study why certain diseases might develop. In each of these situations, researchers merely observe the data that arise. In general, observational studies can provide evidence of a naturally occurring association between variables, but they cannot by themselves show a causal connection.  When researchers want to investigate the possibility of a causal connection, they conduct an experiment . Usually there will be both an explanatory and a response variable. For instance, we may suspect administering a drug will reduce mortality in heart attack patients over the following year. To check if there really is a causal connection between the explanatory variable and the response, researchers will collect a sample of individuals and split them into groups. The individuals in each group are assigned a treatment. When individuals are randomly assigned to a group, the experiment is called a randomized experiment . For example, each heart attack patient in the drug trial could be randomly assigned, perhaps by flipping a coin, into one of two groups: the first group receives a placebo (fake treatment) and the second group receives the drug. See the case study in for another example of an experiment, though that study did not employ a placebo.   Association does not imply causation  In general, association does not imply causation, and causation can only be inferred from a randomized experiment.     Exercises   Air pollution and birth outcomes, study components   Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM 10 and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.

Buteyko method, study components   The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These patients were randomly split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.   Identify the main research question of the study.

Cheaters, study components   Researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15. Participants reported their age, sex, and whether they were an only child or not. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they would only reward children who report white. The study found differences in cheating rates based on instructions and characteristics.   Identify the main research question of the study.

They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. After completing some unrelated tasks, participants reported the number of candies they had taken. It was found that those who were identified as upper-class took more candy than others.

  "title": "Sampling principles and strategies",
  "body": " Sampling principles and strategies   The first step in conducting research is to identify topics or questions that are to be investigated. A clearly laid out research question is helpful in identifying what subjects or cases should be studied and what variables are important. It is also important to consider how data are collected so that they are reliable and help achieve the research goals.    Populations and samples  Consider the following three research questions:    What is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?    Over the last 5 years, what is the average time to complete a degree for Duke undergrads?    Does a new drug reduce the number of deaths in patients with severe heart disease?    Each research question refers to a target population . In the first question, the target population is all swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean, and each fish represents a case. Often times, it is too expensive to collect data for every case in a population. Instead, a sample is taken. A sample represents a subset of the cases and is often a small fraction of the population. For instance, 60 swordfish (or some other number) in the population might be selected, and this sample data may be used to provide an estimate of the population average and answer the research question.   Identifying populations   For the second and third questions above, identify the target population and what represents an individual case.    (2) This question is only relevant to students who complete their degree; the average cannot be computed using a student who never finished her degree. Thus, only Duke undergrads who graduated in the last five years represent cases in the population under consideration. Each such student is an individual case. (3) A person with severe heart disease represents a case. The population includes all people with severe heart disease.      Anecdotal evidence  Consider the following possible responses to the three research questions:    A man on the news got mercury poisoning from eating swordfish, so the average mercury concentration in swordfish must be dangerously high.    I met two students who took more than 7 years to graduate from Duke, so it must take longer to graduate at Duke than at many other colleges.    My friend's dad had a heart attack and died after they gave him a new heart disease drug, so the drug must not work.    Each conclusion is based on data. However, there are two problems. First, the data only represent one or two cases. Second, and more importantly, it is unclear whether these cases are actually representative of the population. Data collected in this haphazard fashion are called anecdotal evidence .   In February 2010, some media pundits cited one large snow storm as valid evidence against global warming. As comedian Jon Stewart pointed out, It's one storm, in one region, of one country.    A wintery scene, where the trees are covered in snow, and there are large piles of snow on the sides of the roads.     Anecdotal evidence  Be careful of data collected in a haphazard fashion. Such evidence may be true and verifiable, but it may only represent extraordinary cases.   Anecdotal evidence typically is composed of unusual cases that we recall based on their striking characteristics. For instance, we are more likely to remember the two people we met who took 7 years to graduate than the six others who graduated in four years. Instead of looking at the most unusual cases, we should examine a sample of many cases that represent the population.    Sampling from a population  We might try to estimate the time to graduation for Duke undergraduates in the last 5 years by collecting a sample of students. All graduates in the last 5 years represent the population , and graduates who are selected for review are collectively called the sample . In general, we always seek to randomly select a sample from a population. The most basic type of random selection is equivalent to how raffles are conducted. For example, in selecting graduates, we could write each graduate's name on a raffle ticket and draw 100 tickets. The selected names would represent a random sample of 100 graduates. We pick samples randomly to reduce the chance we introduce biases.   In this graphic, five graduates are randomly selected from the population to be included in the sample.   Graphic showing a larger circle on the left for all graduates and a smaller circle on the right for sample. Five graduates are randomly selected with arrows showing the selection.     Unintentional bias   Suppose we ask a student who happens to be majoring in nutrition to select several graduates for the study. What kind of students do you think she might collect? Do you think her sample would be representative of all graduates?  Perhaps she would pick a disproportionate number of graduates from health-related fields. Or perhaps her selection would be a good representation of the population. When selecting samples by hand, we run the risk of picking a biased sample, even if their bias isn't intended.     Asked to pick a sample of graduates, a nutrition major might inadvertently pick a disproportionate number of graduates from health-related majors.   Graphic showing sampling only from a subset (health-related fields) introduces bias.    If someone was permitted to pick and choose exactly which graduates were included in the sample, it is entirely possible that the sample could be skewed to that person's interests, which may be entirely unintentional. This introduces bias into a sample. Sampling randomly helps resolve this problem. The most basic random sample is called a simple random sample , which is equivalent to using a raffle to select cases. This means that each case in the population has an equal chance of being included and there is no implied connection between the cases in the sample.  The act of taking a simple random sample helps minimize bias. However, bias can crop up in other ways. Even when people are picked at random, e.g. for surveys, caution must be exercised if the non-response rate is high. For instance, if only 30% of the people randomly sampled for a survey actually respond, then it is unclear whether the results are representative of the entire population. This non-response bias can skew results.   Due to the possibility of non-response, survey studies may only reach a certain group within the population. It is difficult, and often times impossible, to completely fix this problem.   Graphic showing a population of interest with a smaller circle representing the population actually sampled, from which a sample is drawn.    Another common downfall is a convenience sample , where individuals who are easily accessible are more likely to be included in the sample. For instance, if a political survey is done by stopping people walking in the Bronx, this will not represent all of New York City. It is often difficult to discern what sub-population a convenience sample represents.   Interpreting online reviews   We can easily access ratings for products, sellers, and companies through websites. These ratings are based only on those people who go out of their way to provide a rating. If 50% of online reviews for a product are negative, do you think this means that 50% of buyers are dissatisfied with the product?    Answers will vary. From our own anecdotal experiences, we believe people tend to rant more about products that fell below expectations than rave about those that perform as expected. For this reason, we suspect there is a negative bias in product ratings on sites like Amazon. However, since our experiences may not be representative, we also keep an open mind.      Observational studies  Data where no treatment has been explicitly applied (or explicitly withheld) is called observational data . For instance, the loan data and county data described in are both examples of observational data. Making causal conclusions based on experiments is often reasonable. However, making the same causal conclusions based on observational data can be treacherous and is not recommended. Thus, observational studies are generally only sufficient to show associations or form hypotheses that we later check using experiments.   Sunscreen and skin cancer   Suppose an observational study tracked sunscreen use and skin cancer, and it was found that the more sunscreen someone used, the more likely the person was to have skin cancer. Does this mean sunscreen causes skin cancer?    No. See the paragraph following the exercise for an explanation.    Some previous research tells us that using sunscreen actually reduces skin cancer risk, so maybe there is another variable that can explain this hypothetical association between sunscreen usage and skin cancer. One important piece of information that is absent is sun exposure. If someone is out in the sun all day, she is more likely to use sunscreen and more likely to get skin cancer. Exposure to the sun is unaccounted for in the simple investigation.   Sun exposure is a confounding variable that is associated with both sunscreen use and skin cancer.   Diagram showing three boxes in a triangle: sun exposure at the top with arrows pointing to use sunscreen and skin cancer below, with a question mark on a lighter arrow between use sunscreen and skin cancer.    Sun exposure is what is called a confounding variable , Also called a lurking variable , confounding factor , or a confounder . which is a variable that is correlated with both the explanatory and response variables. While one method to justify making causal conclusions from observational studies is to exhaust the search for confounding variables, there is no guarantee that all confounding variables can be examined or measured.   Confounding in county data   Figure shows a negative association between the homeownership rate and the percentage of multi-unit structures in a county. However, it is unreasonable to conclude that there is a causal relationship between the two variables. Suggest a variable that might explain the negative relationship.    Answers will vary. Population density may be important. If a county is very dense, then this may require a larger fraction of residents to live in multi-unit structures. Additionally, the high density may contribute to increases in property value, making homeownership infeasible for many residents.    Observational studies come in two forms: prospective and retrospective studies. A prospective study identifies individuals and collects information as events unfold. For instance, medical researchers may identify and follow a group of patients over many years to assess the possible influences of behavior on cancer risk. One example of such a study is The Nurses' Health Study, started in 1976 and expanded in 1989. This prospective study recruits registered nurses and then collects data from them using questionnaires. Retrospective studies collect data after events have taken place, e.g. researchers may review past events in medical records. Some data sets may contain both prospectively- and retrospectively-collected variables.    Four sampling methods  Almost all statistical methods are based on the notion of implied randomness. If observational data are not collected in a random framework from a population, these statistical methods the estimates and errors associated with the estimates are not reliable. Here we consider four random sampling techniques: simple, stratified, cluster, and multistage sampling. and provide graphical representations of these techniques.   Examples of simple random and stratified sampling. In the top panel, simple random sampling was used to randomly select the 18 cases. In the bottom panel, stratified sampling was used: cases were grouped into strata, then simple random sampling was employed within each stratum.   Two figures showing simple random sampling (top) with 18 randomly selected points, and stratified sampling (bottom) with 6 strata and 3 points selected from each stratum.     Simple random sampling is probably the most intuitive form of random sampling. Consider the salaries of Major League Baseball (MLB) players, where each player is a member of one of the league's 30 teams. To take a simple random sample of 120 baseball players and their salaries, we could write the names of that season's several hundreds of players onto slips of paper, drop the slips into a bucket, shake the bucket around until we are sure the names are all mixed up, then draw out slips until we have the sample of 120 players. In general, a sample is referred to as simple random if each case in the population has an equal chance of being included in the final sample and knowing that a case is included in a sample does not provide useful information about which other cases are included.   Stratified sampling is a divide-and-conquer sampling strategy. The population is divided into groups called strata . The strata are chosen so that similar cases are grouped together, then a second sampling method, usually simple random sampling, is employed within each stratum. In the baseball salary example, the teams could represent the strata, since some teams have a lot more money (up to 4 times as much!). Then we might randomly sample 4 players from each team for a total of 120 players.  Stratified sampling is especially useful when the cases in each stratum are very similar with respect to the outcome of interest. The downside is that analyzing data from a stratified sample is a more complex task than analyzing data from a simple random sample. The analysis methods introduced in this book would need to be extended to analyze data collected using stratified sampling.   Benefits of stratified sampling   Why would it be good for cases within each stratum to be very similar?  We might get a more stable estimate for the subpopulation in a stratum if the cases are very similar, leading to more precise estimates within each group. When we combine these estimates into a single estimate for the full population, that population estimate will tend to be more precise since each individual group estimate is itself more precise.    In a cluster sample , we break up the population into many groups, called clusters . Then we sample a fixed number of clusters and include all observations from each of those clusters in the sample. A multistage sample is like a cluster sample, but rather than keeping all observations in each cluster, we collect a random sample within each selected cluster.   Examples of cluster and multistage sampling. In the top panel, cluster sampling was used: data were binned into nine clusters, three of these clusters were sampled, and all observations within these three clusters were included in the sample. In the bottom panel, multistage sampling was used, which differs from cluster sampling only in that we randomly select a subset of each cluster to be included in the sample rather than measuring every case in each sampled cluster.   Two figures showing cluster sampling (top) with all observations from selected clusters, and multistage sampling (bottom) with random samples from within selected clusters.    Sometimes cluster or multistage sampling can be more economical than the alternative sampling techniques. Also, unlike stratified sampling, these approaches are most helpful when there is a lot of case-to-case variability within a cluster but the clusters themselves don't look very different from one another. For example, if neighborhoods represented clusters, then cluster or multistage sampling work best when the neighborhoods are very diverse. A downside of these methods is that more advanced techniques are typically required to analyze the data, though the methods in this book can be extended to handle such data.   Choosing a sampling design   Suppose we are interested in estimating the malaria rate in a densely tropical portion of rural Indonesia. We learn that there are 30 villages in that part of the Indonesian jungle, each more or less similar to the next. Our goal is to test 150 individuals for malaria. What sampling method should be employed?  A simple random sample would likely draw individuals from all 30 villages, which could make data collection extremely expensive. Stratified sampling would be a challenge since it is unclear how we would build strata of similar individuals. However, cluster sampling or multistage sampling seem like very good ideas. If we decided to use multistage sampling, we might randomly select half of the villages, then randomly select 10 people from each. This would probably reduce our data collection costs substantially in comparison to a simple random sample, and the cluster sample would still give us reliable information, even if we would need to analyze the data with slightly more advanced methods than we discuss in this book.

For each proposed method below, indicate whether the method is reasonable or not.    Survey a simple random sample of 500 students.    Stratify students by their field of study, then sample 10% of students from each stratum.    Cluster students by their ages (e.g. 18 years old in one cluster, 19 years old in one cluster, etc.), then randomly sample three clusters and survey all students in those clusters.       Random digit dialing   The Gallup Poll uses a procedure called random digit dialing, which creates phone numbers based on a list of all area codes in America in conjunction with the associated number of residential households in each area code. Give a possible reason the Gallup Poll chooses to use random digit dialing instead of picking phone numbers from the phone book.     Haters are gonna hate, study confirms   A study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology asked a group of 200 randomly sampled men and women to evaluate how they felt about various subjects, such as camping, health care, architecture, taxidermy, crossword puzzles, and Japan in order to measure their attitude towards mostly independent stimuli. Then, they presented the participants with information about a new product: a microwave oven. This microwave oven does not exist, but the participants didn't know this, and were given three positive and three negative fake reviews. People who reacted positively to the subjects on the dispositional attitude measurement also tended to react positively to the microwave oven, and those who reacted negatively tended to react negatively to it. Researchers concluded that \"some people tend to like things, whereas others tend to dislike things, and a more thorough understanding of this tendency will lead to a more thorough understanding of the psychology of attitudes.\" Citation: Hepler:2013     What are the cases?    What is (are) the response variable(s) in this study?    What is (are) the explanatory variable(s) in this study?    Does the study employ random sampling?    Is this an observational study or an experiment? Explain your reasoning.    Can we establish a causal link between the explanatory and response variables?    Can the results of the study be generalized to the population at large?       Family size   Suppose we want to estimate household size, where a \"household\" is defined as people living together in the same dwelling, and sharing living accommodations. If we select students at random at an elementary school and ask them what their family size is, will this be a good measure of household size? Or will our average be biased? If so, will it overestimate or underestimate the true value?     Sampling strategies   A statistics student who is curious about the relationship between the amount of time students spend on social networking sites and their performance at school decides to conduct a survey. Various research strategies for collecting data are described below. In each, name the sampling method proposed and any bias you might expect.    He randomly samples 40 students from the study's population, gives them the survey, asks them to fill it out and bring it back the next day.    He gives out the survey only to his friends, making sure each one of them fills out the survey.    He posts a link to an online survey on Facebook and asks his friends to fill out the survey.    He randomly samples 5 classes and asks a random sample of students from those classes to fill out the survey.       Reading the paper   Below are excerpts from two articles published in the NY Times :    An article titled Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to Dementia states the following: Citation: news:smokingDementia   \"Researchers analyzed data from 23,123 health plan members who participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, when they were 50-60 years old. 23 years later, about 25% of the group had dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer's disease and 416 with vascular dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37% more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, and the risks went up with increased smoking; 44% for one to two packs a day; and twice the risk for more than two packs.\"  Based on this study, can we conclude that smoking causes dementia later in life? Explain your reasoning.    Another article titled The School Bully Is Sleepy states the following: Citation: news:bullySleep   \"The University of Michigan study, collected survey data from parents on each child's sleep habits and asked both parents and teachers to assess behavioral concerns. About a third of the students studied were identified by parents or teachers as having problems with disruptive behavior or bullying. The researchers found that children who had behavioral issues and those who were identified as bullies were twice as likely to have shown symptoms of sleep disorders.\"  A friend of yours who read the article says, \"The study shows that sleep disorders lead to bullying in school children.\" Is this statement justified? If not, how best can you describe the conclusion that can be drawn from this study?       "

What sampling method should be employed?  A simple random sample would likely draw individuals from all 30 villages, which could make data collection extremely expensive. Stratified sampling would be a challenge since it is unclear how we would build strata of similar individuals. However, cluster sampling or multistage sampling seem like very good ideas. If we decided to use multistage sampling, we might randomly select half of the villages, then randomly select 10 people from each. This would probably reduce our data collection costs substantially in comparison to a simple random sample, and the cluster sample would still give us reliable information, even if we would need to analyze the data with slightly more advanced methods than we discuss in this book.

People who reacted positively to the subjects on the dispositional attitude measurement also tended to react positively to the microwave oven, and those who reacted negatively tended to react negatively to it. Researchers concluded that \"some people tend to like things, whereas others tend to dislike things, and a more thorough understanding of this tendency will lead to a more thorough understanding of the psychology of attitudes.\" Citation: Hepler:2013     What are the cases?

After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37% more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, and the risks went up with increased smoking; 44% for one to two packs a day; and twice the risk for more than two packs.\"  Based on this study, can we conclude that smoking causes dementia later in life?

Another article titled The School Bully Is Sleepy states the following: Citation: news:bullySleep   \"The University of Michigan study, collected survey data from parents on each child's sleep habits and asked both parents and teachers to assess behavioral concerns. About a third of the students studied were identified by parents or teachers as having problems with disruptive behavior or bullying. The researchers found that children who had behavioral issues and those who were identified as bullies were twice as likely to have shown symptoms of sleep disorders.\"  A friend of yours who read the article says, \"The study shows that sleep disorders lead to bullying in school children.\" Is this statement justified?

  "title": "Experiments",
  "body": " Experiments   Studies where the researchers assign treatments to cases are called experiments . When this assignment includes randomization, e.g. using a coin flip to decide which treatment a patient receives, it is called a randomized experiment . Randomized experiments are fundamentally important when trying to show a causal connection between two variables.    Principles of experimental design  Randomized experiments are generally built on four principles.    Controlling.  Researchers assign treatments to cases, and they do their best to control any other differences in the groups. This is a different concept than a control group , which we discuss in the second principle and in . For example, when patients take a drug in pill form, some patients take the pill with only a sip of water while others may have it with an entire glass of water. To control for the effect of water consumption, a doctor may ask all patients to drink a 12 ounce glass of water with the pill.    Randomization.  Researchers randomize patients into treatment groups to account for variables that cannot be controlled. For example, some patients may be more susceptible to a disease than others due to their dietary habits. Randomizing patients into the treatment or control group helps even out such differences, and it also prevents accidental bias from entering the study.    Replication.  The more cases researchers observe, the more accurately they can estimate the effect of the explanatory variable on the response. In a single study, we replicate by collecting a sufficiently large sample. Additionally, a group of scientists may replicate an entire study to verify an earlier finding.    Blocking.  Researchers sometimes know or suspect that variables, other than the treatment, influence the response. Under these circumstances, they may first group individuals based on this variable into blocks and then randomize cases within each block to the treatment groups. This strategy is often referred to as blocking . For instance, if we are looking at the effect of a drug on heart attacks, we might first split patients in the study into low-risk and high-risk blocks, then randomly assign half the patients from each block to the control group and the other half to the treatment group, as shown in . This strategy ensures each treatment group has an equal number of low-risk and high-risk patients.     Blocking using a variable depicting patient risk. Patients are first divided into low-risk and high-risk blocks, then each block is evenly separated into the treatment groups using randomization. This strategy ensures an equal representation of patients in each treatment group from both the low-risk and high-risk categories.   There are three main stages shown in this figure, from top to bottom. The upper stage shows the numbering of patients as a rectangle containing 54 dots in a grid that are labeled with numbers 1 through 54. The dots are one of two colors: blue (high risk) and red (low risk). The second stage shows the two colored dots broken into two blocks. On the left are the low-risk patients (red) and on the right are the high-risk patients (blue). Going into the bottom third stage, are two boxes labeled \"control\" and \"treatment\", where half of the low-risk (red) and half of the blue (high risk) points have been randomly placed into each of these two experiment groups.    It is important to incorporate the first three experimental design principles into any study, and this book describes applicable methods for analyzing data from such experiments. Blocking is a slightly more advanced technique, and statistical methods in this book may be extended to analyze data collected using blocking.    Reducing bias in human experiments  Randomized experiments are the gold standard for data collection, but they do not ensure an unbiased perspective into the cause and effect relationship in all cases. Human studies are perfect examples where bias can unintentionally arise. Here we reconsider a study where a new drug was used to treat heart attack patients. In particular, researchers wanted to know if the drug reduced deaths in patients.  These researchers designed a randomized experiment because they wanted to draw causal conclusions about the drug's effect. Study volunteers Human subjects are often called patients , volunteers , or study participants . were randomly placed into two study groups. One group, the treatment group , received the drug. The other group, called the control group , did not receive any drug treatment.  Put yourself in the place of a person in the study. If you are in the treatment group, you are given a fancy new drug that you anticipate will help you. On the other hand, a person in the other group doesn't receive the drug and sits idly, hoping her participation doesn't increase her risk of death. These perspectives suggest there are actually two effects: the one of interest is the effectiveness of the drug, and the second is an emotional effect that is difficult to quantify.  Researchers aren't usually interested in the emotional effect, which might bias the study. To circumvent this problem, researchers do not want patients to know which group they are in. When researchers keep the patients uninformed about their treatment, the study is said to be blind . But there is one problem: if a patient doesn't receive a treatment, she will know she is in the control group. The solution to this problem is to give fake treatments to patients in the control group. A fake treatment is called a placebo , and an effective placebo is the key to making a study truly blind. A classic example of a placebo is a sugar pill that is made to look like the actual treatment pill. Often times, a placebo results in a slight but real improvement in patients. This effect has been dubbed the placebo effect .  The patients are not the only ones who should be blinded: doctors and researchers can accidentally bias a study. When a doctor knows a patient has been given the real treatment, she might inadvertently give that patient more attention or care than a patient that she knows is on the placebo. To guard against this bias, which again has been found to have a measurable effect in some instances, most modern studies employ a double-blind setup where doctors or researchers who interact with patients are, just like the patients, unaware of who is or is not receiving the treatment. There are always some researchers involved in the study who do know which patients are receiving which treatment. However, they do not interact with the study's patients and do not tell the blinded health care professionals who is receiving which treatment.    Blinding in the stent study   Look back to the study in where researchers were testing whether stents were effective at reducing strokes in at-risk patients. Is this an experiment? Was the study blinded? Was it double-blinded?    The researchers assigned the patients into their treatment groups, so this study was an experiment. However, the patients could distinguish what treatment they received, so this study was not blind. The study could not be double-blind since it was not blind.     Placebos via sham surgery   For the study in , could the researchers have employed a placebo? If so, what would that placebo have looked like?    Ultimately, can we make patients think they got treated from a surgery? In fact, we can, and some experiments use what's called a sham surgery . In a sham surgery, the patient does undergo surgery, but the patient does not receive the full treatment, though they will still get a placebo effect.    You may have many questions about the ethics of sham surgeries to create a placebo after reading the previous exercise. These questions may have even arisen in your mind in the general experiment context, where a possibly helpful treatment was withheld from individuals in the control group; the main difference is that a sham surgery tends to create additional risk, while withholding a treatment only maintains a person's risk.  There are always multiple viewpoints of experiments and placebos, and rarely is it obvious which is ethically correct . For instance, is it ethical to use a sham surgery when it creates a risk to the patient? However, if we don't use sham surgeries, we may promote the use of a costly treatment that has no real effect; if this happens, money and other resources will be diverted away from other treatments that are known to be helpful. Ultimately, this is a difficult situation where we cannot perfectly protect both the patients who have volunteered for the study and the patients who may benefit (or not) from the treatment in the future.    Exercises   Light and exam performance   A study is designed to test the effect of light level on exam performance of students. The researcher believes that light levels might have different effects on males and females, so wants to make sure both are equally represented in each treatment. The treatments are fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps).    What is the response variable?    What is the explanatory variable? What are its levels?    What is the blocking variable? What are its levels?       Vitamin supplements   To assess the effectiveness of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university. A quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo, and the rest were evenly divided between 1g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at onset of a cold for the following two days. All tablets had identical appearance and packaging. The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the patients knew which patient received which treatment, but the researchers assessing the patients when they were sick did not. No significant differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of symptoms. Citation: Audera:2001     Was this an experiment or an observational study? Why?    What are the explanatory and response variables in this study?    Were the patients blinded to their treatment?    Was this study double-blind?    Participants are ultimately able to choose whether or not to use the pills prescribed to them. We might expect that not all of them will adhere and take their pills. Does this introduce a confounding variable to the study? Explain your reasoning.       Light, noise, and exam performance   A study is designed to test the effect of light level and noise level on exam performance of students. The researcher believes that light and noise levels might have different effects on males and females, so wants to make sure both are equally represented in each treatment. The light treatments considered are fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps). The noise treatments considered are no noise, construction noise, and human chatter noise.    What type of study is this?    How many factors are considered in this study? Identify them, and describe their levels.    What is the role of the sex variable in this study?       Music and learning   You would like to conduct an experiment in class to see if students learn better if they study without any music, with music that has no lyrics (instrumental), or with music that has lyrics. Briefly outline a design for this study.     Soda preference   You would like to conduct an experiment in class to see if your classmates prefer the taste of regular Coke or Diet Coke. Briefly outline a design for this study.     Exercise and mental health   A researcher is interested in the effects of exercise on mental health and he proposes the following study: Use stratified random sampling to ensure representative proportions of 18-30, 31-40 and 41- 55 year olds from the population. Next, randomly assign half the subjects from each age group to exercise twice a week, and instruct the rest not to exercise. Conduct a mental health exam at the beginning and at the end of the study, and compare the results.    What type of study is this?    What are the treatment and control groups in this study?    Does this study make use of blocking? If so, what is the blocking variable?    Does this study make use of blinding?    Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be used to establish a causal relationship between exercise and mental health, and indicate whether or not the conclusions can be generalized to the population at large.    Suppose you are given the task of determining if this proposed study should get funding. Would you have any reservations about the study proposal?       "

Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they are asked to return after their parents have completed it. One of the questions asked is, \"Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with your kids after school?\" Of the parents who replied, 85% said \"no\". Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a great majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids after school.    A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who recently gave birth, asking them about whether or not they smoked during pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems is conducted 3 years later. However, only 567 of these women are reached at the same address.

  "title": "Examining numerical data",
  "body": " Examining numerical data   In this section we will explore techniques for summarizing numerical variables. For example, consider the loan_amount variable from the loan50 data set, which represents the loan size for all 50 loans in the data set. This variable is numerical since we can sensibly discuss the numerical difference of the size of two loans. On the other hand, area codes and zip codes are not numerical, but rather they are categorical variables.  Throughout this section and the next, we will apply these methods using the loan50 and county data sets, which were introduced in . If you'd like to review the variables from either data set, see the relevant data description figures.     Scatterplots for paired data  A scatterplot provides a case-by-case view of data for two numerical variables. In a previous figure, a scatterplot was used to examine the homeownership rate against the fraction of housing units that were part of multi-unit properties (e.g. apartments) in the county data set. Another scatterplot is shown in , comparing the total income of a borrower ( total_income ) and the amount they borrowed ( loan_amount ) for the loan50 data set. In any scatterplot, each point represents a single case. Since there are 50 cases in loan50 , there are 50 points in .   A scatterplot of total_income versus loan_amount for the loan50 data set   A scatterplot is shown with \"Total Income\" along the horizontal axis (range from $0 to $325,000) and \"Loan Amount\" along the vertical axis (range from $0 to $40,000). The points lie in a range from $2,000 to $33,000 in loan amount when total income is smaller than $150,000 (representing most of the points). The range of loan amounts is higher when total income is greater than $175,000, with the range of observations being about $15,000 to $40,000.    Looking at , we see that there are many borrowers with an income below $100,000 on the left side of the graph, while there are a handful of borrowers with income above $250,000.   Nonlinear relationships in scatterplots    shows a plot of median household income against the poverty rate for 3,142 counties. What can be said about the relationship between these variables?    The relationship is evidently nonlinear , as highlighted by the dashed line. This is different from previous scatterplots we've seen, which show relationships that do not show much, if any, curvature in the trend.     A scatterplot of the median household income against the poverty rate for the county data set   A scatterplot of a few thousand points is shown with \"Poverty Rate\" along the horizontal axis (range from 0% to 55%) and \"Median Household Income\" along the vertical axis (range from $0 to $130,000). A curved trend line is overlaid on the points starting higher on the left and decreasing as it moves right, but it starts flattening the further right it goes. Below 10% poverty rate, points range from about $40,000 to $130,000. Between 10% to 20%, the range is lower at about $25,000 to close to $100,000. For 20% to 30%, the points range from about $22,000 to just over $60,000. For 30% to 50%, the trend is mostly flat with values ranging from about $20,000 to $50,000.     Value of scatterplots   What do scatterplots reveal about the data, and how are they useful?    Answers may vary. Scatterplots are helpful in quickly spotting associations relating variables, whether those associations come in the form of simple trends or whether those relationships are more complex.     Horseshoe-shaped associations   Describe two variables that would have a horseshoe-shaped association in a scatterplot ( or ).    Consider the case where your vertical axis represents something \"good\" and your horizontal axis represents something that is only good in moderation. Health and water consumption fit this description: we require some water to survive, but consume too much and it becomes toxic and can kill a person.       Dot plots and the mean  Sometimes two variables are one too many: only one variable may be of interest. In these cases, a dot plot provides the most basic of displays. A dot plot is a one-variable scatterplot; an example using the interest rate of 50 loans is shown in . A stacked version of this dot plot is shown in .   A dot plot of interest_rate for the loan50 data set   A dot plot is shown for the variable \"Interest Rate\". There is a horizontal axis ranging from about 5% to a bit over 25%, and then several points are shown horizontally above the axis, scattered over the range. There is a higher density of points between 5% to 11%, with a moderate density of points from 12% to about 20%, and then a few more observations at about 22%, 25%, and 26%. A red triangle is also shown at approximately 12%.     A stacked dot plot of interest_rate for the loan50 data set   A stacked dot plot is shown for the variable \"Interest Rate\". There is a horizontal axis ranging from about 5% to a bit over 25%, and then several stacks of points are shown at values 5%, 6%, 7%, and so on. There are 3 points stacked at 5%, 3 points stacked at 6%, 5 at 7%, 4 at 8%, 5 at 9%, 8 at 10%, 5 at 11%, 1 at 11%, 3 at 12%, then 1 each at 14%, 15%, and 16%, 3 at 17%, 2 at 18%, and then 1 each at 19%, 20%, 21%, 25%, and 26%. A red triangle is also shown at approximately 12%. The rates have been rounded to the nearest percent in this plot.    The mean , often called the average , is a common way to measure the center of a distribution of data. To compute the mean interest rate, we add up all the interest rates and divide by the number of observations: The sample mean is often labeled . The letter is being used as a generic placeholder for the variable of interest, interest_rate , and the bar over the communicates we're looking at the average interest rate, which for these 50 loans was 11.57%. It is useful to think of the mean as the balancing point of the distribution, and it's shown as a triangle in and .   Mean  The sample mean can be computed as the sum of the observed values divided by the number of observations: where , , , represent the observed values.    Understanding mean notation   Examine the equation for the mean. What does correspond to? And ? Can you infer a general meaning to what might represent?     corresponds to the interest rate for the first loan in the sample (10.90%), to the second loan's interest rate (9.92%), and corresponds to the interest rate for the loan in the data set. For example, if , then we're examining , which refers to the fourth observation in the data set.     Sample size   What was in this sample of loans?    The sample size was .    The loan50 data set represents a sample from a larger population of loans made through Lending Club. We could compute a mean for this population in the same way as the sample mean. However, the population mean has a special label: . The symbol is the Greek letter mu and represents the average of all observations in the population. Sometimes a subscript, such as , is used to represent which variable the population mean refers to, e.g. . Often times it is too expensive to measure the population mean precisely, so we often estimate using the sample mean, .   Estimating a population mean   The average interest rate across all loans in the population can be estimated using the sample data. Based on the sample of 50 loans, what would be a reasonable estimate of , the mean interest rate for all loans in the full data set?    The sample mean, 11.57%, provides a rough estimate of . While it's not perfect, this is our single best guess of the average interest rate of all the loans in the population under study. In later chapters, we will develop tools to characterize the accuracy of point estimates like the sample mean. As you might have guessed, point estimates based on larger samples tend to be more accurate than those based on smaller samples.     Using the mean for comparisons   The mean is useful because it allows us to rescale or standardize a metric into something more easily interpretable and comparable. Provide 2 examples where the mean is useful for making comparisons.       We would like to understand if a new drug is more effective at treating asthma attacks than the standard drug. A trial of 1500 adults is set up, where 500 receive the new drug, and 1000 receive a standard drug in the control group. The results show 200 asthma attacks in the new drug group and 300 in the standard drug group. Comparing the raw counts of 200 to 300 asthma attacks would make it appear that the new drug is better, but this is an artifact of the imbalanced group sizes. Instead, we should look at the average number of asthma attacks per patient in each group: New drug: , Standard drug: . The standard drug has a lower average number of asthma attacks per patient than the average in the treatment group.    Emilio opened a food truck last year where he sells burritos, and his business has stabilized over the last 3 months. Over that 3 month period, he has made $11,000 while working 625 hours. Emilio's average hourly earnings provides a useful statistic for evaluating whether his venture is, at least from a financial perspective, worth it: . By knowing his average hourly wage, Emilio now has put his earnings into a standard unit that is easier to compare with many other jobs that he might consider.        Weighted means   Suppose we want to compute the average income per person in the US. To do so, we might first think to take the mean of the per capita incomes across the 3,142 counties in the county data set. What would be a better approach?    The county data set is special in that each county actually represents many individual people. If we were to simply average across the income variable, we would be treating counties with 5,000 and 5,000,000 residents equally in the calculations. Instead, we should compute the total income for each county, add up all the counties' totals, and then divide by the number of people in all the counties. If we completed these steps with the county data, we would find that the per capita income for the US is $30,861. Had we computed the simple mean of per capita income across counties, the result would have been just $26,093! This example used what is called a weighted mean . For more information on this topic, check out online supplements regarding weighted means.       Histograms and shape  Dot plots show the exact value for each observation. This is useful for small data sets, but they can become hard to read with larger samples. Rather than showing the value of each observation, we prefer to think of the value as belonging to a bin . For example, in the loan50 data set, we created a table of counts for the number of loans with interest rates between 5.0% and 7.5%, then the number of loans with rates between 7.5% and 10.0%, and so on. Observations that fall on the boundary of a bin (e.g. 10.00%) are allocated to the lower bin. This tabulation is shown in . These binned counts are plotted as bars in into what is called a histogram , which resembles a more heavily binned version of the stacked dot plot.   Counts for the binned interest_rate data    Interest Rate  5.0%-7.5%  7.5%-10.0%  10.0%-12.5%  12.5%-15.0%   25.0%-27.5%    Count  11  15  8  4   1      A histogram of interest_rate . This distribution is strongly skewed to the right.   A histogram with a horizontal axis of \"Interest Rate\" and a vertical axis showing the frequency of occurrence of different bins of interest rate. The first bin is from 5%-7.5% with a frequency (count) of 11 observations, 7.5%-10% has a frequency of 15, 10%-12.5% has 8, 12.5%-15% has 4, 15%-17.5% has 5, 17.5%-20% has 4, and then the 20%-22.5%, 22.5%-25%, and 25%-27.5% bins each have a frequency of 1.    Histograms provide a view of the data density . Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common. For instance, there are many more loans with rates between 5% and 10% than loans with rates between 20% and 25% in the data set. The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data changes relative to the interest rate.  Histograms are especially convenient for understanding the shape of the data distribution. suggests that most loans have rates under 15%, while only a handful of loans have rates above 20%. When data trail off to the right in this way and has a longer right tail, the shape is said to be right skewed . Other ways to describe data that are right skewed: skewed to the right, skewed to the high end, or skewed to the positive end.   Data sets with the reverse characteristic a long, thinner tail to the left are said to be left skewed . We also say that such a distribution has a long left tail. Data sets that show roughly equal trailing off in both directions are called symmetric .   Long tails to identify skew  When data trail off in one direction, the distribution has a long tail . If a distribution has a long left tail, it is left skewed. If a distribution has a long right tail, it is right skewed.    Identifying skew   Take a look at the dot plots in earlier figures. Can you see the skew in the data? Is it easier to see the skew in this histogram or the dot plots?    The skew is visible in all three plots, though the flat dot plot is the least useful. The stacked dot plot and histogram are helpful visualizations for identifying skew.     Histogram limitations   Besides the mean (since it was labeled), what can you see in the dot plots that you cannot see in the histogram?    The interest rates for individual loans.    In addition to looking at whether a distribution is skewed or symmetric, histograms can be used to identify modes. A mode is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution. There is only one prominent peak in the histogram of loan_amount .  A definition of mode sometimes taught in math classes is the value with the most occurrences in the data set. However, for many real-world data sets, it is common to have no observations with the same value in a data set, making this definition impractical in data analysis.   shows histograms that have one, two, or three prominent peaks. Such distributions are called unimodal , bimodal , and multimodal , respectively. Any distribution with more than 2 prominent peaks is called multimodal. Notice that there was one prominent peak in the unimodal distribution with a second less prominent peak that was not counted since it only differs from its neighboring bins by a few observations.   Distributions showing different numbers of modes   Three histograms are shown. The first histogram shows bins of width 2 between 0 to 18 (this is along the horizontal axis), and the frequencies are 3, 16, 16, 7, 11, 6, 4, 1, and 1. The second histogram, representing a different data set, shows bins of width 2 with values ranging from 0 to 20, where the bin counts in order are 2, 9, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 10, 19, and 9. The third histogram, representing yet another data set, shows bins of width 2 with values ranging from 0 to 22, where the bin counts in order are 10, 8, 4, 3, 1, 20, 15, 3, 15, 18, and 5.     Identifying modality    reveals only one prominent mode in the interest rate. Is the distribution unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal?    Unimodal. Remember that uni stands for 1 (think uni cycles). Similarly, bi stands for 2 (think bi cycles). We're hoping a multicycle will be invented to complete this analogy.     Expected modes in height data   Height measurements of young students and adult teachers at a K-3 elementary school were taken. How many modes would you expect in this height data set?    There might be two height groups visible in the data set: one of the students and one of the adults. That is, the data are probably bimodal.    Looking for modes isn't about finding a clear and correct answer about the number of modes in a distribution, which is why prominent is not rigorously defined in this book. The most important part of this examination is to better understand your data.     Variance and standard deviation  The mean was introduced as a method to describe the center of a data set, and variability in the data is also important. Here, we introduce two measures of variability: the variance and the standard deviation. Both of these are very useful in data analysis, even though their formulas are a bit tedious to calculate by hand. The standard deviation is the easier of the two to comprehend, and it roughly describes how far away the typical observation is from the mean.  We call the distance of an observation from its mean its deviation . Below are the deviations for the 1 , 2 , 3 , and 50 observations in the interest_rate variable: If we square these deviations and then take an average, the result is equal to the sample variance , denoted by : We divide by , rather than dividing by , when computing a sample's variance; there's some mathematical nuance here, but the end result is that doing this makes this statistic slightly more reliable and useful.  Notice that squaring the deviations does two things. First, it makes large values relatively much larger, seen by comparing , , , and . Second, it gets rid of any negative signs.  The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance: While often omitted, a subscript of may be added to the variance and standard deviation, i.e. and , if it is useful as a reminder that these are the variance and standard deviation of the observations represented by , , ..., .   Variance and standard deviation  The variance is the average squared distance from the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is useful when considering how far the data are distributed from the mean.  The standard deviation represents the typical deviation of observations from the mean. Usually about 70% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean and about 95% will be within two standard deviations. However, these percentages are not strict rules.   Like the mean, the population values for variance and standard deviation have special symbols: for the variance and for the standard deviation. The symbol is the Greek letter sigma .   Standard deviations in the interest rate distribution   A dot plot of 50 observations is shown with values ranging from about 5% to 26%. The data set is the same as that shown in earlier dot plots, where the data is more dense from 5% to about 11%, has medium density from about 12% to 20%, and then there are a few more values scattered in the 20% to 27% range. Shading is shown to represent the regions within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations. The region within 1 standard deviation is from 6.5% to 16.7%, representing 34 of the 50 data points. The region within 2 standard deviations runs left off of the chart (but would be from about 1.4%) to 21.8% and contains 48 of the 50 data points. The third standard deviation is shown to extend out to 26.9%, and all 50 observations are contained within the 3 standard deviations.    For the interest_rate variable, 34 of the 50 loans (68%) had interest rates within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and 48 of the 50 loans (96%) had rates within 2 standard deviations. Usually about 70% of the data are within 1 standard deviation of the mean and 95% within 2 standard deviations, though this is far from a hard rule.   Three very different population distributions with the same mean and standard deviation   Three histograms are shown (upper, middle, lower). Each distribution also shows shading -- dark gray between -1 to 1, lighter gray between -2 and 2, and light gray between -3 and 3, and then very light gray further out. The upper plot shows only two bins with non-zero values and of equal height at -1 and 1. The middle plot shows a bell-shaped curve, where most of the higher bin values are between -1 and 1, middling heights are between -2 to -1 and 1 to 2, and the data trails off in each direction with ever-smaller values further out. The lower histogram shows no data below about -1.6, a quick increase to a peak at about -0.7 and then a slow decline of values to about half the max height at 1 and further trails off to ever smaller values to a horizontal location of 3 and beyond.     Importance of shape description   The concept of shape of a distribution was introduced earlier. A good description of the shape of a distribution should include modality and whether the distribution is symmetric or skewed to one side. Using as an example, explain why such a description is important.     shows three distributions that look quite different, but all have the same mean, variance, and standard deviation. Using modality, we can distinguish between the first plot (bimodal) and the last two (unimodal). Using skewness, we can distinguish between the last plot (right skewed) and the first two. While a picture, like a histogram, tells a more complete story, we can use modality and shape (symmetry\/skew) to characterize basic information about a distribution.     Describing a distribution   Describe the distribution of the interest_rate variable using the histogram in . The description should incorporate the center, variability, and shape of the distribution, and it should also be placed in context. Also note any especially unusual cases.    The distribution of interest rates is unimodal and skewed to the high end. Many of the rates fall near the mean at 11.57%, and most fall within one standard deviation (5.05%) of the mean. There are a few exceptionally large interest rates in the sample that are above 20%.    In practice, the variance and standard deviation are sometimes used as a means to an end, where the \"end\" is being able to accurately estimate the uncertainty associated with a sample statistic. For example, in later chapters the standard deviation is used in calculations that help us understand how much a sample mean varies from one sample to the next.     Box plots, quartiles, and the median  A box plot summarizes a data set using five statistics while also plotting unusual observations. provides a vertical dot plot alongside a box plot of the interest_rate variable from the loan50 data set.   A vertical dot plot next to a labeled box plot for the interest rates of the 50 loans   What is shown is a dot plot adjacent to what is called a \"box plot\". The data values are the same ones used in past dot plots, where the data shows greatest density from 5% to 11%, moderate density from 12% to 20%, and then a few more values at about 22%, 25%, and 26%. The box plot adjacent to the data shows a box that would encapsulate the middle 50% of the data, from about 8% to 13%. The median is also annotated with a line through the center of the box. From here, the data extend out with \"whiskers\" up to a distance up to 1.5 times IQR below and above the box to capture as much data as possible. There are two observations that extend beyond this range at 25% and 26%.    The first step in building a box plot is drawing a dark line denoting the median , which splits the data in half. shows 50% of the data falling below the median and other 50% falling above the median. There are 50 loans in the data set (an even number) so the data are perfectly split into two groups of 25. We take the median in this case to be the average of the two observations closest to the 50 percentile, which happen to be the same value in this data set: . When there are an odd number of observations, there will be exactly one observation that splits the data into two halves, and in such a case that observation is the median (no average needed).   Median: the number in the middle  If the data are ordered from smallest to largest, the median is the observation right in the middle. If there are an even number of observations, there will be two values in the middle, and the median is taken as their average.   The second step in building a box plot is drawing a rectangle to represent the middle 50% of the data. The total length of the box, shown vertically in , is called the interquartile range ( IQR , for short). It, like the standard deviation, is a measure of variability in data. The more variable the data, the larger the standard deviation and IQR tend to be. The two boundaries of the box are called the first quartile (the 25 percentile, i.e. 25% of the data fall below this value) and the third quartile (the 75 percentile), and these are often labeled and , respectively.   Interquartile range (IQR)  The IQR is the length of the box in a box plot. It is computed as where and are the 25 and 75 percentiles.    Data between quartiles   What percent of the data fall between and the median? What percent is between the median and ?    Since and capture the middle 50% of the data and the median splits the data in the middle, 25% of the data fall between and the median, and another 25% falls between the median and .    Extending out from the box, the whiskers attempt to capture the data outside of the box. However, their reach is never allowed to be more than . They capture everything within this reach. In , the upper whisker does not extend to the last two points, which is beyond , and so it extends only to the last point below this limit. The lower whisker stops at the lowest value, 5.31%, since there is no additional data to reach; the lower whisker's limit is not shown in the figure because the plot does not extend down to . In a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot and the whiskers are like its arms trying to reach the rest of the data.  Any observation lying beyond the whiskers is labeled with a dot. The purpose of labeling these points instead of extending the whiskers to the minimum and maximum observed values is to help identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data. Unusually distant observations are called outliers . In this case, it would be reasonable to classify the interest rates of 24.85% and 26.30% as outliers since they are numerically distant from most of the data.   Outliers are extreme  An outlier is an observation that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data.  Examining data for outliers serves many useful purposes, including:  Identifying strong skew in the distribution.  Identifying possible data collection or data entry errors.  Providing insight into interesting properties of the data.      Estimating quartiles from a box plot   Using , estimate the following values for interest_rate in the loan50 data set: (a) , (b) , and (c) IQR.    These visual estimates will vary a little from one person to the next: 8%, 14%, 6%. (The true values: , , .)       Robust statistics  How are the sample statistics of the interest_rate data set affected by the observation, 26.3%? What would have happened if this loan had instead been only 15%? What would happen to these summary statistics if the observation at 26.3% had been even larger, say 35%? These scenarios are plotted alongside the original data in , and sample statistics are computed under each scenario in .   Dot plots of the original interest rate data and two modified data sets   Three dot plots are shown in the same plot. The largest observation from the original data set (discussed in previous dot plots) at about 26% is moved to 15% in the second dot plot and instead to 35% in the third dot plot.     Comparison of statistics under different scenarios    Scenario  Robust  Not Robust     Median  IQR      Original interest_rate data  9.93%  5.76%  11.57%  5.05%    Move 26.3% 15%  9.93%  5.76%  11.34%  4.61%    Move 26.3% 35%  9.93%  5.76%  11.74%  5.68%      Comparing robustness of statistics   (a) Which is more affected by extreme observations, the mean or median? may be helpful. (b) Is the standard deviation or IQR more affected by extreme observations?    (a) Mean is affected more. (b) Standard deviation is affected more. Complete explanations are provided below.    The median and IQR are called robust statistics because extreme observations have little effect on their values: moving the most extreme value generally has little influence on these statistics. On the other hand, the mean and standard deviation are more heavily influenced by changes in extreme observations, which can be important in some situations.   Stability of robust statistics   The median and IQR did not change under the three scenarios in . Why might this be the case?    The median and IQR are only sensitive to numbers near , the median, and . Since values in these regions are stable in the three data sets, the median and IQR estimates are also stable.     Choosing between mean and median   The distribution of loan amounts in the loan50 data set is right skewed, with a few large loans lingering out into the right tail. If you were wanting to understand the typical loan size, should you be more interested in the mean or median?    Answers will vary! If we're looking to simply understand what a typical individual loan looks like, the median is probably more useful. However, if the goal is to understand something that scales well, such as the total amount of money we might need to have on hand if we were to offer 1,000 loans, then the mean would be more useful.       Transforming data (special topic)  When data are very strongly skewed, we sometimes transform them so they are easier to model.   County population distributions: (a) original data showing extreme skew, (b) log-transformed data   Two histograms are shown side by side. The first histogram has a horizontal axis of Population with possible data ranging from 0 to about 10 million. The first bar representing 0 to 400,000 shows a frequency (bar height) of about 3000, the second bar for 400,000 to 800,000 shows about frequency of about 100. All other bars are sufficiently small that they are virtually indistinguishable from 0. The second histogram shows the horizontal axis represents log-base-10 of the population. The horizontal axis runs from about 2 to 7, and frequency (bin\/box height) peaks at a little over 1000. The data show an approximate bell shape, peaking in the middle between 4 to 4.5, then showing lower frequencies the further out from 4-4.5 with frequencies being close to zero outside of 2.5 to 6.5.     Issues with extreme skew   Consider the histogram of county populations shown in (left panel), which shows extreme skew. What isn't useful about this plot?    Nearly all of the data fall into the left-most bin, and the extreme skew obscures many of the potentially interesting details in the data.    There are some standard transformations that may be useful for strongly right skewed data where much of the data is positive but clustered near zero. A transformation is a rescaling of the data using a function. For instance, a plot of the logarithm (base 10) of county populations results in the new histogram in (right panel). This data is symmetric, and any potential outliers appear much less extreme than in the original data set. By reigning in the outliers and extreme skew, transformations like this often make it easier to build statistical models against the data.  Transformations can also be applied to one or both variables in a scatterplot. A scatterplot of the population change from 2010 to 2017 against the population in 2010 is shown in . In the first scatterplot, it's hard to decipher any interesting patterns because the population variable is so strongly skewed. However, if we apply a log transformation to the population variable, as shown in the second panel, a positive association between the variables is revealed.   Scatterplots of population change vs. population: (a) original data, (b) log-transformed population   Two scatterplots are shown side by side. The first scatterplot has population on the horizontal axis (ranging from 0 to 10 million) and population change as a percent on the vertical axis (ranging from -35% to positive 40%). The data is particularly concentrated on the left of the graph below 1 million. There is no discernible trend in the data. The second scatterplot has log-base-10 of the population on the horizontal axis (ranging from 2 to 7) and population change as a percent on the vertical axis. The data is well distributed and shows a cloud of points with a slight upward trend.    Transformations other than the logarithm can be useful, too. For instance, the square root and inverse are commonly used by data scientists. Common goals in transforming data are to see the data structure differently, reduce skew, assist in modeling, or straighten a nonlinear relationship in a scatterplot.     Mapping data (special topic)  The county data set offers many numerical variables that we could plot using dot plots, scatterplots, or box plots, but these miss the true nature of the data. Rather, when we encounter geographic data, we should create an intensity map , where colors are used to show higher and lower values of a variable. Figures throughout this book demonstrate a variety of intensity maps for county-level data including poverty rate ( poverty ), unemployment rate ( unemployment_rate ), homeownership rate ( homeownership ), and median household income ( median_hh_income ). The color key indicates which colors correspond to which values. The intensity maps are not generally very helpful for getting precise values in any given county, but they are very helpful for seeing geographic trends and generating interesting research questions or hypotheses.   Features in poverty and unemployment intensity maps   What interesting features are evident in the poverty and unemployment_rate intensity maps?    Poverty rates are evidently higher in a few locations. Notably, the deep south shows higher poverty rates, as does much of Arizona and New Mexico. High poverty rates are evident in the Mississippi flood plains a little north of New Orleans and also in a large section of Kentucky.  The unemployment rate follows similar trends, and we can see correspondence between the two variables. In fact, it makes sense for higher rates of unemployment to be closely related to poverty rates. One observation that stands out when comparing the two maps: the poverty rate is much higher than the unemployment rate, meaning while many people may be working, they are not making enough to break out of poverty.     Features in median household income map   What interesting features are evident in the median_hh_income intensity map?    Note: answers will vary. There is some correspondence between high earning and metropolitan areas, where we can see darker spots (higher median household income), though there are several exceptions. You might look for large cities you are familiar with and try to spot them on the map as dark spots.      "

A trial of 1500 adults is set up, where 500 receive the new drug, and 1000 receive a standard drug in the control group. The results show 200 asthma attacks in the new drug group and 300 in the standard drug group. Comparing the raw counts of 200 to 300 asthma attacks would make it appear that the new drug is better, but this is an artifact of the imbalanced group sizes. Instead, we should look at the average number of asthma attacks per patient in each group: New drug: , Standard drug: . The standard drug has a lower average number of asthma attacks per patient than the average in the treatment group.

To do so, we might first think to take the mean of the per capita incomes across the 3,142 counties in the county data set. What would be a better approach?    The county data set is special in that each county actually represents many individual people. If we were to simply average across the income variable, we would be treating counties with 5,000 and 5,000,000 residents equally in the calculations. Instead, we should compute the total income for each county, add up all the counties' totals, and then divide by the number of people in all the counties. If we completed these steps with the county data, we would find that the per capita income for the US is $30,861. Had we computed the simple mean of per capita income across counties, the result would have been just $26,093! This example used what is called a weighted mean .

Poverty rates are evidently higher in a few locations. Notably, the deep south shows higher poverty rates, as does much of Arizona and New Mexico. High poverty rates are evident in the Mississippi flood plains a little north of New Orleans and also in a large section of Kentucky.  The unemployment rate follows similar trends, and we can see correspondence between the two variables. In fact, it makes sense for higher rates of unemployment to be closely related to poverty rates. One observation that stands out when comparing the two maps: the poverty rate is much higher than the unemployment rate, meaning while many people may be working, they are not making enough to break out of poverty.

  "title": "Considering categorical data",
  "body": " Considering categorical data   In this section, we will introduce tables and other basic tools for categorical data that are used throughout this book. The loan50 data set represents a sample from a larger loan data set called loans . This larger data set contains information on 10,000 loans made through Lending Club. We will examine the relationship between homeownership , which for the loans data can take a value of rent , mortgage (owns but has a mortgage), or own , and app_type , which indicates whether the loan application was made with a partner or whether it was an individual application.     Contingency tables and bar plots   summarizes two variables: app_type and homeownership . A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables in this way is called a contingency table . Each value in the table represents the number of times a particular combination of variable outcomes occurred. For example, the value 3,496 corresponds to the number of loans in the data set where the borrower rents their home and the application type was by an individual. Row and column totals are also included. The row totals provide the total counts across each row (e.g. ), and column totals are total counts down each column. We can also create a table that shows only the overall percentages or proportions for each combination of categories, or we can create a table for a single variable, such as the one shown in for the homeownership variable.   A contingency table for app_type and homeownership      homeownership       rent  mortgage  own  Total    app_type  individual  3,496  3,839  1,170  8,505     joint  362  950  183  1,495     Total  3,858  4,789  1,353  10,000      A table summarizing the frequencies of each value for the homeownership variable    homeownership  Count    rent  3,858    mortgage  4,789    own  1,353    Total  10,000     A bar plot is a common way to display a single categorical variable. shows a bar plot for the homeownership variable. In the left panel, the bar plot shows counts. In the right panel, the counts are converted into proportions, showing the proportion of observations that are in each level (e.g. for rent ).   Two bar plots of homeownership: (left) counts, (right) proportions   Two bar plots are shown side by side. The left bar plot has Homeownership on the horizontal axis and Frequency (count) on the vertical axis. Each level of homeownership has its own \"bar\" (which looks like a tall rectangle resting on the horizontal axis) with a height corresponding to the frequency of that bar in the data set. For example, the \"Rent\" bar extends from the horizontal axis up to a frequency of about 3900. The \"Mortgage\" bar extends from the horizontal axis up to about 4700, and the bar for \"Own\" extends up to about 1300. Moving to the next plot, the right bar plot, it looks very similar to the left bar plot except that it reports the proportion of cases on the vertical axis instead of the frequency (count). The values in this bar plot are: about 0.39 for Rent, about 0.47 for Mortgage, and about 0.13 for Own.       Row and column proportions  Sometimes it is useful to understand the fractional breakdown of one variable in another, and we can modify our contingency table to provide such a view. shows the row proportions for , which are computed as the counts divided by their row totals. The value 3,496 at the intersection of individual and rent is replaced by , i.e. 3,496 divided by its row total, 8,505. So what does 0.411 represent? It corresponds to the proportion of individual applicants who rent.   A contingency table with row proportions for app_type and homeownership     rent  mortgage  own  Total    individual  0.411  0.451  0.138  1.000    joint  0.242  0.635  0.122  1.000    Total  0.386  0.479  0.135  1.000     A contingency table of the column proportions is computed in a similar way, where each column proportion is computed as the count divided by the corresponding column total. shows such a table, and here the value 0.906 indicates that 90.6% of renters applied as individuals for the loan. This rate is higher compared to loans from people with mortgages (80.2%) or who own their home (86.5%). Because these rates vary between the three levels of homeownership , this provides evidence that the app_type and homeownership variables are associated.   A contingency table with column proportions for app_type and homeownership     rent  mortgage  own  Total    individual  0.906  0.802  0.865  0.851    joint  0.094  0.198  0.135  0.150    Total  1.000  1.000  1.000  1.000     We could also have checked for an association between app_type and homeownership using row proportions. When comparing these row proportions, we would look down columns to see if the fraction of loans where the borrower rents, has a mortgage, or owns varied across the individual to joint application types.   Interpreting proportions   (a) What does 0.451 represent in ? (b) What does 0.802 represent in ?    (a) 0.451 represents the proportion of individual applicants who have a mortgage. (b) 0.802 represents the fraction of applicants with mortgages who applied as individuals.     Email spam classification   Data scientists use statistics to filter spam from incoming email messages. By noting specific characteristics of an email, a data scientist may be able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with high accuracy. One such characteristic is the email format, which indicates whether or not an email has any HTML content. We'll focus on email format and spam status using the email data set, and these variables are summarized in a contingency table. Which would be more helpful to someone hoping to classify email as spam or regular email: row or column proportions?    A data scientist would be interested in how the proportion of spam changes within each email format. This corresponds to column proportions: the proportion of spam in plain text emails and the proportion of spam in HTML emails. If we generate the column proportions, we can see that a higher fraction of plain text emails are spam (17.5%) than compared to HTML emails (5.8%). This information on its own is insufficient to classify an email as spam or not spam, as over 80% of plain text emails are not spam. Yet, when we carefully combine this information with many other characteristics, we stand a reasonable chance of being able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with confidence.    Example points out that row and column proportions are not equivalent. Before settling on one form for a table, it is important to consider each to ensure that the most useful table is constructed. However, sometimes it simply isn't clear which, if either, is more useful.   Determining table usefulness   Look back to the row and column proportion tables for app_type and homeownership . Are there any obvious scenarios where one might be more useful than the other?    None that we thought were obvious! What is distinct about app_type and homeownership versus the email example is that these two variables don't have a clear explanatory-response variable relationship that we might hypothesize. Usually it is most useful to \"condition\" on the explanatory variable. For instance, in the email example, the email format was seen as a possible explanatory variable of whether the message was spam, so we would find it more interesting to compute the relative frequencies (proportions) for each email format.       Using a bar plot with two variables  Contingency tables using row or column proportions are especially useful for examining how two categorical variables are related. Stacked bar plots provide a way to visualize the information in these tables.  A stacked bar plot is a graphical display of contingency table information. For example, a stacked bar plot is shown in (left panel), where we have first created a bar plot using the homeownership variable and then divided each group by the levels of app_type . One related visualization is the side-by-side bar plot , shown in (middle panel). For the last type, the column proportions have been translated into a standardized stacked bar plot in (right panel). This type of visualization is helpful in understanding the fraction of individual or joint loan applications for borrowers in each level of homeownership . Since the proportions vary across the groups, we can conclude that the two variables are associated.   Bar plot variants: (left) stacked, (middle) side-by-side, (right) standardized stacked   Three bar plots are shown side by side showing different representations of the same data. All plots show homeownership on the horizontal axis with levels rent, mortgage, and own. The first plot shows a stacked bar plot with frequency counts, the second shows bars side-by-side for each homeownership level, and the third shows standardized bars all reaching to 1.0 on the vertical axis.     Choosing bar plot variants   Examine the three bar plots in . When is the stacked, side-by-side, or standardized stacked bar plot the most useful?    The stacked bar plot is most useful when it's reasonable to assign one variable as the explanatory variable and the other as the response. Side-by-side bar plots are more agnostic about which variable represents the explanatory and which the response variable. The standardized stacked bar plot is helpful if the primary variable is relatively imbalanced, making the simple stacked bar plot less useful for checking for an association. The major downside is that we lose all sense of how many cases each bar represents.       Mosaic plots  A mosaic plot is a visualization technique suitable for contingency tables that resembles a standardized stacked bar plot with the benefit that we still see the relative group sizes of the primary variable as well.  To get started in creating our first mosaic plot, we'll break a square into columns for each category of the homeownership variable. Each column represents a level of homeownership , and the column widths correspond to the proportion of loans in each of those categories. In general, mosaic plots use box areas to represent the number of cases in each category.   Mosaic plots: (left) one-variable for homeownership, (right) two-variable with app_type   Two mosaic plots are shown. The left plot shows a square divided vertically into three sections for rent (about 40%), mortgage (about 48%), and own (about 12%). The right plot further subdivides each vertical section horizontally to show the breakdown by application type (individual and joint).    To create a completed mosaic plot, the single-variable mosaic plot is further divided using the app_type variable. Each column is split proportional to the number of loans from individual and joint borrowers. For example, the second column represents loans where the borrower has a mortgage, and it was divided into individual loans (upper) and joint loans (lower). As another example, the bottom segment of the third column represents loans where the borrower owns their home and applied jointly, while the upper segment of this column represents borrowers who are homeowners and filed individually. We can again use this plot to see that the homeownership and app_type variables are associated, since some columns are divided in different vertical locations than others, which was the same technique used for checking an association in the standardized stacked bar plot.  In the mosaic plots shown, we chose to first split by the homeowner status of the borrower. However, we could have instead first split by the application type. Like with the bar plots, it's common to use the explanatory variable to represent the first split in a mosaic plot, and then for the response to break up each level of the explanatory variable, if these labels are reasonable to attach to the variables under consideration.     The only pie chart you will see in this book  A pie chart is shown alongside a bar plot representing the same information. Pie charts can be useful for giving a high-level overview to show how a set of cases break down. However, it is also difficult to decipher details in a pie chart. For example, it takes a couple seconds longer to recognize that there are more loans where the borrower has a mortgage than rent when looking at the pie chart, while this detail is very obvious in the bar plot. While pie charts can be useful, we prefer bar plots for their ease in comparing groups.   A pie chart and bar plot of homeownership   Two plots are shown side by side. The left is a pie chart divided into three slices: mortgage (blue, about 48%), rent (green, about 39%), and own (red, about 13%). The right is a bar plot with the same information showing three bars with frequencies around 3900, 4700, and 1300 respectively.       Comparing numerical data across groups  Some of the more interesting investigations can be considered by examining numerical data across groups. The methods required here aren't really new: all that's required is to make a numerical plot for each group in the same graph. Here two convenient methods are introduced: side-by-side box plots and hollow histograms.  We will take a look again at the county data set and compare the median household income for counties that gained population from 2010 to 2017 versus counties that had no gain. While we might like to make a causal connection here, remember that these are observational data and so such an interpretation would be, at best, half-baked.  There were 1,454 counties where the population increased from 2010 to 2017, and there were 1,672 counties with no gain (all but one were a loss). A random sample of 100 counties from the first group and 50 from the second group are shown in to give a better sense of some of the raw median income data.   Median Income for 150 Counties, in $1000s    Population Gain   No Population Gain    38.2 43.6 42.2 61.5 51.1 45.7   48.3 60.3 50.7    44.6 51.8 40.7 48.1 56.4 41.9   39.3 40.4 40.3    40.6 63.3 52.1 60.3 49.8 51.7   57.0 47.2 45.9    51.1 34.1 45.5 52.8 49.1 51.0   42.3 41.5 46.1    80.8 46.3 82.2 43.6 39.7 49.4   44.9 51.7 46.4    75.2 40.6 46.3 62.4 44.1 51.3   29.1 51.8 50.5    51.9 34.7 54.0 42.9 52.2 45.1   27.0 30.9 34.9    61.0 51.4 56.5 62.0 46.0 46.4   40.7 51.8 61.1    53.8 57.6 69.2 48.4 40.5 48.6   43.4 34.7 45.7    53.1 54.6 55.0 46.4 39.9 56.7   33.1 21.0 37.0    63.0 49.1 57.2 44.1 50.0 38.9   52.0 31.9 45.7    46.6 46.5 38.9 50.9 56.0 34.6   56.3 38.7 45.7    74.2 63.0 49.6 53.7 77.5 60.0   56.2 43.0 21.7    63.2 47.6 55.9 39.1 57.8 42.6   44.5 34.5 48.9    50.4 49.0 45.6 39.0 38.8 37.1   50.9 42.1 43.2    57.2 44.7 71.7 35.3 100.2   35.4 41.3 33.6    42.6 55.5 38.6 52.7 63.0   43.4 56.5     The side-by-side box plot is a traditional tool for comparing across groups. An example is shown in a figure, where there are two box plots, one for each group, placed into one plotting window and drawn on the same scale.  Another useful plotting method uses hollow histograms to compare numerical data across groups. These are just the outlines of histograms of each group put on the same plot.   Comparing income by population change   Use the plots to compare the incomes for counties across the two groups. What do you notice about the approximate center of each group? What do you notice about the variability between groups? Is the shape relatively consistent between groups? How many prominent modes are there for each group?    Answers may vary a little. The counties with population gains tend to have higher income (median of about $45,000) versus counties without a gain (median of about $40,000). The variability is also slightly larger for the population gain group. This is evident in the IQR, which is about 50% bigger in the gain group. Both distributions show slight to moderate right skew and are unimodal. There is a secondary small bump visible in the hollow histograms, though this is an artifact of the small sample sizes chosen for these examples.     Useful plot components   What components of each plot do you find most useful?    Answers will vary. The side-by-side box plots are especially useful for comparing centers and spreads, while the hollow histograms are more useful for seeing distribution shape, skew, and potential anomalies.     "

Side-by-side bar plots are more agnostic about which variable represents the explanatory and which the response variable. The standardized stacked bar plot is helpful if the primary variable is relatively imbalanced, making the simple stacked bar plot less useful for checking for an association.

If and represent the proportion of students who own an Apple product on the left and right, respectively, would you be surprised if did not exactly equal ?    While the proportions would probably be close to each other, it would be unusual for them to be exactly the same. We would probably observe a small difference due to chance.     Independence between seating and ownership   If we don't think the side of the room a person sits on in class is related to whether the person owns an Apple product, what assumption are we making about the relationship between these two variables?    We would be assuming that these two variables are independent.     Variability within data  We consider a study on a new malaria vaccine called PfSPZ. In this study, volunteer patients were randomized into one of two experiment groups: 14 patients received an experimental vaccine and 6 patients received a placebo vaccine. Nineteen weeks later, all 20 patients were exposed to a drug-sensitive malaria parasite strain; the motivation of using a drug-sensitive strain of parasite here is for ethical considerations, allowing any infections to be treated effectively. The results are summarized in , where 9 of the 14 treatment patients remained free of signs of infection while all of the 6 patients in the control group patients showed some baseline signs of infection.   Summary results for the malaria vaccine experiment      outcome  Total      infection  no infection     treatment  vaccine  5  9  14    placebo  6  0  6     Total  11  9  20      Study design and implications   Is this an observational study or an experiment? What implications does the study type have on what can be inferred from the results?    The study is an experiment, as patients were randomly assigned an experiment group. Since this is an experiment, the results can be used to evaluate a causal relationship between the malaria vaccine and whether patients showed signs of an infection.    In this study, a smaller proportion of patients who received the vaccine showed signs of an infection (35.7% versus 100%). However, the sample is very small, and it is unclear whether the difference provides convincing evidence that the vaccine is effective.   Assessing the evidence   Data scientists are sometimes called upon to evaluate the strength of evidence. When looking at the rates of infection for patients in the two groups in this study, what comes to mind as we try to determine whether the data show convincing evidence of a real difference?    The observed infection rates (35.7% for the treatment group versus 100% for the control group) suggest the vaccine may be effective. However, we cannot be sure if the observed difference represents the vaccine's efficacy or is just from random chance. Generally there is a little bit of fluctuation in sample data, and we wouldn't expect the sample proportions to be exactly equal, even if the truth was that the infection rates were independent of getting the vaccine. Additionally, with such small samples, perhaps it's common to observe such large differences when we randomly split a group due to chance alone!    Example is a reminder that the observed outcomes in the data sample may not perfectly reflect the true relationships between variables since there is random noise . While the observed difference in rates of infection is large, the sample size for the study is small, making it unclear if this observed difference represents efficacy of the vaccine or whether it is simply due to chance. We label these two competing claims, and , which are spoken as \"H-nought\" and \"H-A\":      : Independence model. The variables treatment and outcome are independent. They have no relationship, and the observed difference between the proportion of patients who developed an infection in the two groups, 64.3%, was due to chance.     : Alternative model. The variables are not independent. The difference in infection rates of 64.3% was not due to chance, and vaccine affected the rate of infection.     What would it mean if the independence model, which says the vaccine had no influence on the rate of infection, is true? It would mean 11 patients were going to develop an infection no matter which group they were randomized into , and 9 patients would not develop an infection no matter which group they were randomized into . That is, if the vaccine did not affect the rate of infection, the difference in the infection rates was due to chance alone in how the patients were randomized.  Now consider the alternative model: infection rates were influenced by whether a patient received the vaccine or not. If this was true, and especially if this influence was substantial, we would expect to see some difference in the infection rates of patients in the groups.  We choose between these two competing claims by assessing if the data conflict so much with that the independence model cannot be deemed reasonable. If this is the case, and the data support , then we will reject the notion of independence and conclude the vaccine was effective.    Simulating the study  We're going to implement simulations , where we will pretend we know that the malaria vaccine being tested does not work. Ultimately, we want to understand if the large difference we observed is common in these simulations. If it is common, then maybe the difference we observed was purely due to chance. If it is very uncommon, then the possibility that the vaccine was helpful seems more plausible.   shows that 11 patients developed infections and 9 did not. For our simulation, we will suppose the infections were independent of the vaccine and we were able to rewind back to when the researchers randomized the patients in the study. If we happened to randomize the patients differently, we may get a different result in this hypothetical world where the vaccine doesn't influence the infection. Let's complete another randomization using a simulation.  In this simulation , we take 20 notecards to represent the 20 patients, where we write down \"infection\" on 11 cards and \"no infection\" on 9 cards. In this hypothetical world, we believe each patient that got an infection was going to get it regardless of which group they were in, so let's see what happens if we randomly assign the patients to the treatment and control groups again. We thoroughly shuffle the notecards and deal 14 into a vaccine pile and 6 into a placebo pile. Finally, we tabulate the results, which are shown in .   Simulation results, where any difference in infection rates is purely due to chance      outcome  Total      infection  no infection     treatment (simulated)  vaccine  7  7  14    placebo  4  2  6     Total  11  9  20      Simulated difference   What is the difference in infection rates between the two simulated groups in ? How does this compare to the observed 64.3% difference in the actual data?     or about 16.7% in favor of the vaccine. This difference due to chance is much smaller than the difference observed in the actual groups.      Checking for independence  We computed one possible difference under the independence model in Guided Practice , which represents one difference due to chance. While in this first simulation, we physically dealt out notecards to represent the patients, it is more efficient to perform this simulation using a computer. Repeating the simulation on a computer, we get another difference due to chance: And another: And so on until we repeat the simulation enough times that we have a good idea of what represents the distribution of differences from chance alone . shows a stacked plot of the differences found from 100 simulations, where each dot represents a simulated difference between the infection rates (control rate minus treatment rate).   Differences from 100 simulations under the independence model   A stacked dot plot is shown. The horizontal axis represents \"difference in infection rates\" and has a range of -0.6 to 0.8. There are six stacks of dots shown in the plot, with 3 points shown at -0.55, 20-25 points shown at -0.32, 30-35 points shown at -0.08, 25-30 points shown at 0.18, 10-12 points shown at 0.41, and 2 points shown at 0.64.    Note that the distribution of these simulated differences is centered around 0. We simulated these differences assuming that the independence model was true, and under this condition, we expect the difference to be near zero with some random fluctuation, where near is pretty generous in this case since the sample sizes are so small in this study.   Rarity of the observed difference   How often would you observe a difference of at least 64.3% (0.643) according to ? Often, sometimes, rarely, or never?    It appears that a difference of at least 64.3% due to chance alone would only happen about 2% of the time according to . Such a low probability indicates a rare event.    The difference of 64.3% being a rare event suggests two possible interpretations of the results of the study:      : Independence model. The vaccine has no effect on infection rate, and we just happened to observe a difference that would only occur on a rare occasion.     : Alternative model. The vaccine has an effect on infection rate, and the difference we observed was actually due to the vaccine being effective at combatting malaria, which explains the large difference of 64.3%.     Based on the simulations, we have two options. (1) We conclude that the study results do not provide strong evidence against the independence model. That is, we do not have sufficiently strong evidence to conclude the vaccine had an effect in this clinical setting. (2) We conclude the evidence is sufficiently strong to reject and assert that the vaccine was useful. When we conduct formal studies, usually we reject the notion that we just happened to observe a rare event. So in this case, we reject the independence model in favor of the alternative. That is, we are concluding the data provide strong evidence that the vaccine provides some protection against malaria in this clinical setting.  One field of statistics, statistical inference, is built on evaluating whether such differences are due to chance. In statistical inference, data scientists evaluate which model is most reasonable given the data. Errors do occur, just like rare events, and we might choose the wrong model. While we do not always choose correctly, statistical inference gives us tools to control and evaluate how often these errors occur. In Chapter 3, we give a formal introduction to the problem of model selection. We spend the next two chapters building a foundation of probability and theory necessary to make that discussion rigorous.

  "body": " Defining probability   Statistics is based on probability, and while probability is not required for the applied techniques in this book, it may help you gain a deeper understanding of the methods and set a better foundation for future courses.    Introductory examples  Before we get into technical ideas, let's walk through some basic examples that may feel more familiar.    A die , the singular of dice, is a cube with six faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. What is the chance of getting 1 when rolling a die?    If the die is fair, then the chance of a 1 is as good as the chance of any other number. Since there are six outcomes, the chance must be 1-in-6 or, equivalently, .      What is the chance of getting a 1 or 2 in the next roll?    1 and 2 constitute two of the six equally likely possible outcomes, so the chance of getting one of these two outcomes must be .      What is the chance of getting either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 on the next roll?    100%. The outcome must be one of these numbers.      What is the chance of not rolling a 2?    Since the chance of rolling a 2 is or , the chance of not rolling a 2 must be or .  Alternatively, we could have noticed that not rolling a 2 is the same as getting a 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6, which makes up five of the six equally likely outcomes and has probability .      Consider rolling two dice. If of the time the first die is a 1 and of those times the second die is a 1, what is the chance of getting two 1s?    If of the time the first die is a 1 and of those times the second die is also a 1, then the chance that both dice are 1 is or .      Probability  We use probability to build tools to describe and understand apparent randomness. We often frame probability in terms of a random process giving rise to an outcome .  Rolling a die or flipping a coin is a seemingly random process and each gives rise to an outcome: Roll a die 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6; Flip a coin H or T.   Probability  The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.   Probability is defined as a proportion, and it always takes values between 0 and 1 (inclusively). It may also be displayed as a percentage between 0% and 100%.  Probability can be illustrated by rolling a die many times. Let be the proportion of outcomes that are 1 after the first rolls. As the number of rolls increases, will converge to the probability of rolling a 1, . shows this convergence for 100,000 die rolls. The tendency of to stabilize around is described by the Law of Large Numbers .   The fraction of die rolls that are 1 at each stage in a simulation. The proportion tends to get closer to the probability as the number of rolls increases.     Law of Large Numbers  As more observations are collected, the proportion of occurrences with a particular outcome converges to the probability of that outcome.   Occasionally the proportion will veer off from the probability and appear to defy the Law of Large Numbers, as does many times in . However, these deviations become smaller as the number of rolls increases.  Above we write as the probability of rolling a 1. We can also write this probability as As we become more comfortable with this notation, we will abbreviate it further. For instance, if it is clear that the process is rolling a die , we could abbreviate rolling a 1 as .   Random processes   Random processes include rolling a die and flipping a coin. (a) Think of another random process. (b) Describe all the possible outcomes of that process. For instance, rolling a die is a random process with possible outcomes 1, 2, , 6.    Here are four examples. (i) Whether someone gets sick in the next month or not is an apparently random process with outcomes sick and not . (ii) We can generate a random process by randomly picking a person and measuring that person's height. The outcome of this process will be a positive number. (iii) Whether the stock market goes up or down next week is a seemingly random process with possible outcomes up , down , and no_change . Alternatively, we could have used the percent change in the stock market as a numerical outcome. (iv) Whether your roommate cleans her dishes tonight probably seems like a random process with possible outcomes cleans_dishes and leaves_dishes .    What we think of as random processes are not necessarily random, but they may just be too difficult to understand exactly. The fourth example in the solution to suggests a roommate's behavior is a random process. However, even if a roommate's behavior is not truly random, modeling her behavior as a random process can still be useful.    Disjoint or mutually exclusive outcomes  Two outcomes are called disjoint or mutually exclusive if they cannot both happen. For instance, if we roll a die, the outcomes 1 and 2 are disjoint since they cannot both occur. On the other hand, the outcomes 1 and rolling an odd number are not disjoint since both occur if the outcome of the roll is a 1. The terms disjoint and mutually exclusive are equivalent and interchangeable.  Calculating the probability of disjoint outcomes is easy. When rolling a die, the outcomes 1 and 2 are disjoint, and we compute the probability that one of these outcomes will occur by adding their separate probabilities: What about the probability of rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6? Here again, all of the outcomes are disjoint so we add the probabilities: The Addition Rule guarantees the accuracy of this approach when the outcomes are disjoint.   Addition Rule of disjoint outcomes  If and represent two disjoint outcomes, then the probability that one of them occurs is given by If there are many disjoint outcomes , , , then the probability that one of these outcomes will occur is      We are interested in the probability of rolling a 1, 4, or 5. (a) Explain why the outcomes 1, 4, and 5 are disjoint. (b) Apply the Addition Rule for disjoint outcomes to determine 1 or 4 or 5 .    (a) The random process is a die roll, and at most one of these outcomes can come up. This means they are disjoint outcomes. (b) 1 or 4 or 5       In the loans data set in Chapter 1, the homeownership variable described whether the borrower rents, has a mortgage, or owns her property. Of the 10,000 borrowers, 3858 rented, 4789 had a mortgage, and 1353 owned their home.    Are the outcomes rent , mortgage , and own disjoint?  Determine the proportion of loans with value mortgage and own separately.  Use the Addition Rule for disjoint outcomes to compute the probability a randomly selected loan from the data set is for someone who has a mortgage or owns her home.      (a) Yes. Each loan is categorized in only one level of homeownership. (b) Mortgage: . Own: . (c) mortgage or own mortgage own .    Data scientists rarely work with individual outcomes and instead consider sets or collections of outcomes. Let represent the event where a die roll results in 1 or 2 and represent the event that the die roll is a 4 or a 6. We write as the set of outcomes and . These sets are commonly called events . Because and have no elements in common, they are disjoint events. and are represented in .   Three events, , , and , consist of outcomes from rolling a die. and are disjoint since they do not have any outcomes in common.    The Addition Rule applies to both disjoint outcomes and disjoint events. The probability that one of the disjoint events or occurs is the sum of the separate probabilities:     (a) Verify the probability of event , , is using the Addition Rule. (b) Do the same for event .    (a) 1 or 2 . (b) Similarly, .      (a) Using as a reference, what outcomes are represented by event ? (b) Are events and disjoint? (c) Are events and disjoint?    (a) Outcomes 2 and 3. (b) Yes, events and are disjoint because they share no outcomes. (c) The events and share an outcome in common, 2, and so are not disjoint.      In , you confirmed and from are disjoint. Compute the probability that event or event occurs.    Since and are disjoint events, use the Addition Rule: or .      Probabilities when events are not disjoint  Let's consider calculations for two events that are not disjoint in the context of a regular deck of 52 cards, represented in . If you are unfamiliar with the cards in a regular deck, please see the footnote. The 52 cards are split into four suits : (club), (diamond), (heart), (spade). Each suit has its 13 cards labeled: 2, 3, , 10, J (jack), Q (queen), K (king), and A (ace). Thus, each card is a unique combination of a suit and a label, e.g. and . The 12 cards represented by the jacks, queens, and kings are called face cards . The cards that are or are typically colored red while the other two suits are typically colored black.    Representations of the 52 unique cards in a deck.      (a) What is the probability that a randomly selected card is a diamond? (b) What is the probability that a randomly selected card is a face card?    (a) There are 52 cards and 13 diamonds. If the cards are thoroughly shuffled, each card has an equal chance of being drawn, so the probability that a randomly selected card is a diamond is . (b) Likewise, there are 12 face cards, so .     Venn diagrams are useful when outcomes can be categorized as in or out for two or three variables, attributes, or random processes. The Venn diagram in uses a circle to represent diamonds and another to represent face cards. If a card is both a diamond and a face card, it falls into the intersection of the circles. If it is a diamond but not a face card, it will be in part of the left circle that is not in the right circle (and so on). The total number of cards that are diamonds is given by the total number of cards in the diamonds circle: . The probabilities are also shown (e.g. ).   A Venn diagram for diamonds and face cards.    Let represent the event that a randomly selected card is a diamond and represent the event that it is a face card. How do we compute ? Events and are not disjoint the cards , , and fall into both categories so we cannot use the Addition Rule for disjoint events. Instead we use the Venn diagram. We start by adding the probabilities of the two events: However, the three cards that are in both events were counted twice, once in each probability. We must correct this double counting: This equation is an example of the General Addition Rule .   General Addition Rule  If and are any two events, disjoint or not, then the probability that at least one of them will occur is where is the probability that both events occur.    or is inclusive  When we write or in statistics, we mean and\/or unless we explicitly state otherwise. Thus, or occurs means , , or both and occur.     (a) If and are disjoint, describe why this implies . (b) Using part (a), verify that the General Addition Rule simplifies to the simpler Addition Rule for disjoint events if and are disjoint.    (a) If and are disjoint, and can never occur simultaneously. (b) If and are disjoint, then the last term in the General Addition Rule formula is 0 (see part (a)) and we are left with the Addition Rule for disjoint events.      In the loans data set describing 10,000 loans, 1495 loans were from joint applications (e.g. a couple applied together), 4789 applicants had a mortgage, and 950 had both of these characteristics. Create a Venn diagram for this setup.    Both the counts and corresponding probabilities (e.g. ) are shown. Notice that the number of loans represented in the left circle corresponds to , and the number represented in the right circle is .         (a) Use your Venn diagram from the previous exercise to determine the probability a randomly drawn loan from the loans data set is from a joint application where the couple had a mortgage. (b) What is the probability that the loan had either of these attributes?    (a) The solution is represented by the intersection of the two circles: 0.095. (b) This is the sum of the three disjoint probabilities shown in the circles: (off by 0.001 due to a rounding error).      Probability distributions  A probability distribution is a table of all disjoint outcomes and their associated probabilities. shows the probability distribution for the sum of two dice.   Probability distribution for the sum of two dice.    Dice sum  2 3 4 5 6 7  8 9 10 11 12    Probability          Rules for probability distributions  A probability distribution is a list of the possible outcomes with corresponding probabilities that satisfies three rules:    The outcomes listed must be disjoint.  Each probability must be between 0 and 1.  The probabilities must total 1.        suggests three distributions for household income in the United States. Only one is correct. Which one must it be? What is wrong with the other two?    The probabilities of (a) do not sum to 1. The second probability in (b) is negative. This leaves (c), which sure enough satisfies the requirements of a distribution. One of the three was said to be the actual distribution of US household incomes, so it must be (c).     Proposed distributions of US household incomes.    Income Range  $0-25k $25k-50k $50k-100k $100k+    (a)  0.18 0.39 0.33 0.16    (b)  0.38 -0.27 0.52 0.37    (c)  0.28 0.27 0.29 0.16     Chapter 1 emphasized the importance of plotting data to provide quick summaries. Probability distributions can also be summarized in a bar plot. For instance, the distribution of US household incomes is shown in as a bar plot. The probability distribution for the sum of two dice is shown in and plotted in .   The probability distribution of US household income.     The probability distribution of the sum of two dice.    In these bar plots, the bar heights represent the probabilities of outcomes. If the outcomes are numerical and discrete, it is usually (visually) convenient to make a bar plot that resembles a histogram, as in the case of the sum of two dice. Another example of plotting the bars at their respective locations is shown in in .    Complement of an event  Rolling a die produces a value in the set . This set of all possible outcomes is called the sample space ( ) for rolling a die. We often use the sample space to examine the scenario where an event does not occur.  Let represent the event that the outcome of a die roll is 2 or 3. Then the complement of represents all outcomes in our sample space that are not in , which is denoted by . That is, is the set of all possible outcomes not already included in . shows the relationship between , , and the sample space .   Event and its complement, . represents the sample space, which is the set of all possible outcomes.      (a) Compute . (b) What is ?    (a) The outcomes are disjoint and each has probability , so the total probability is . (b) We can also see that . Since and are disjoint, .      Events and are shown in . (a) Write out what and represent. (b) Compute and . (c) Compute and .    Brief solutions: (a) and . (b) Noting that each outcome is disjoint, add the individual outcome probabilities to get and . (c) and are disjoint, and the same is true of and . Therefore, and .    A complement of an event is constructed to have two very important properties: (i) every possible outcome not in is in , and (ii) and are disjoint. Property (i) implies That is, if the outcome is not in , it must be represented in . We use the Addition Rule for disjoint events to apply Property (ii): Combining the last two equations yields a very useful relationship between the probability of an event and its complement.   Complement  The complement of event is denoted , and represents all outcomes not in . and are mathematically related:    In simple examples, computing or is feasible in a few steps. However, using the complement can save a lot of time as problems grow in complexity.    Let represent the event where we roll two dice and their total is less than 12. (a) What does the event represent? (b) Determine from . (c) Determine .    (a) The complement of : when the total is equal to 12. (b) . (c) Use the probability of the complement from part (b), , and the equation for the complement: .      Find the following probabilities for rolling two dice:    The sum of the dice is not 6.  The sum is at least 4. That is, determine the probability of the event .  The sum is no more than 10. That is, determine the probability of the event .      (a) First find , then use the complement: . (b) First find the complement, which requires much less effort: . Then calculate . (c) As before, finding the complement is the clever way to determine . First find . Then calculate .      Independence  Just as variables and observations can be independent, random processes can be independent, too. Two processes are independent if knowing the outcome of one provides no useful information about the outcome of the other. For instance, flipping a coin and rolling a die are two independent processes knowing the coin was heads does not help determine the outcome of a die roll. On the other hand, stock prices usually move up or down together, so they are not independent.   provides a basic example of two independent processes: rolling two dice. We want to determine the probability that both will be 1. Suppose one of the dice is red and the other white. If the outcome of the red die is a 1, it provides no information about the outcome of the white die. We first encountered this same question in , where we calculated the probability using the following reasoning: of the time the red die is a 1, and of those times the white die will also be a 1. This is illustrated in . Because the rolls are independent, the probabilities of the corresponding outcomes can be multiplied to get the final answer: . This can be generalized to many independent processes.   of the time, the first roll is a 1. Then of those times, the second roll will also be a 1.      What if there was also a blue die independent of the other two? What is the probability of rolling the three dice and getting all 1s?    The same logic applies from . If of the time the white and red dice are both 1, then of those times the blue die will also be 1, so multiply:      illustrates what is called the Multiplication Rule for independent processes.   Multiplication Rule for independent processes  If and represent events from two different and independent processes, then the probability that both and occur can be calculated as the product of their separate probabilities: Similarly, if there are events from independent processes, then the probability they all occur is      About 9% of people are left-handed. Suppose 2 people are selected at random from the U.S. population. Because the sample size of 2 is very small relative to the population, it is reasonable to assume these two people are independent. (a) What is the probability that both are left-handed? (b) What is the probability that both are right-handed?    (a) The probability the first person is left-handed is 0.09, which is the same for the second person. We apply the Multiplication Rule for independent processes to determine the probability that both will be left-handed: . (b) It is reasonable to assume the proportion of people who are ambidextrous (both right- and left-handed) is nearly 0, which results in . Using the same reasoning as in part (a), the probability that both will be right-handed is .      Suppose 5 people are selected at random.    What is the probability that all are right-handed?  What is the probability that all are left-handed?  What is the probability that not all of the people are right-handed?      (a) The abbreviations RH and LH are used for right-handed and left-handed, respectively. Since each are independent, we apply the Multiplication Rule for independent processes: (b) Using the same reasoning as in (a), . (c) Use the complement, , to answer this question:     Suppose the variables handedness and sex are independent, i.e. knowing someone's sex provides no useful information about their handedness and vice-versa. Then we can compute whether a randomly selected person is right-handed and female The actual proportion of the U.S. population that is female is about 50%, and so we use 0.5 for the probability of sampling a woman. However, this probability does differ in other countries. using the Multiplication Rule:     Three people are selected at random.    What is the probability that the first person is male and right-handed?  What is the probability that the first two people are male and right-handed?  What is the probability that the third person is female and left-handed?  What is the probability that the first two people are male and right-handed and the third person is female and left-handed?      Brief answers are provided. (a) This can be written in probability notation as . (b) 0.207. (c) 0.045. (d) 0.0093.    Sometimes we wonder if one outcome provides useful information about another outcome. The question we are asking is, are the occurrences of the two events independent? We say that two events and are independent if they satisfy .    If we shuffle up a deck of cards and draw one, is the event that the card is a heart independent of the event that the card is an ace?    The probability the card is a heart is and the probability that it is an ace is . The probability the card is the ace of hearts is . We check whether is satisfied: Because the equation holds, the event that the card is a heart and the event that the card is an ace are independent events.     "

For example a car insurance company will consider information about a person's driving history to assess the risk that they will be responsible for an accident. These types of relationships are the realm of conditional probabilities.    Exploring probabilities with a contingency table  The photo_classify data set represents a classifier for a sample of 1822 photos from a photo sharing website. Data scientists have been working to improve a classifier for whether the photo is about fashion or not, and these 1822 photos represent a test for their classifier. Each photo gets two classifications: the first is called mach_learn and gives a classification from a machine learning (ML) system of either pred_fashion or pred_not . Each of these 1822 photos have also been classified carefully by a team of people, which we take to be the source of truth; this variable is called truth and takes values fashion and not . summarizes the results.

If a photo is actually about fashion, what is the chance the ML classifier correctly identified the photo as being about fashion?    We can estimate this probability using the data. Of the 309 fashion photos, the ML algorithm correctly classified 197 of the photos:       We sample a photo from the data set and learn the ML algorithm predicted this photo was not about fashion. What is the probability that it was incorrect and the photo is about fashion?    If the ML classifier suggests a photo is not about fashion, then it comes from the second row in the data set. Of these 1603 photos, 112 were actually about fashion:       Marginal and joint probabilities   includes row and column totals for each variable separately in the photo_classify data set. These totals represent marginal probabilities for the sample, which are the probabilities based on a single variable without regard to any other variables. For instance, a probability based solely on the mach_learn variable is a marginal probability: A probability of outcomes for two or more variables or processes is called a joint probability : It is common to substitute a comma for and in a joint probability, although using either the word and or a comma is acceptable.   Marginal and joint probabilities  If a probability is based on a single variable, it is a marginal probability . The probability of outcomes for two or more variables or processes is called a joint probability .   We use table proportions to summarize joint probabilities for the photo_classify sample. These proportions are computed by dividing each count by the table's total, 1822, to obtain the probabilities in . The joint probability distribution of the mach_learn and truth variables is shown in .   Probability table summarizing the photo_classify data set.     truth: fashion  truth: not  Total    mach_learn: pred_fashion  0.1081  0.0121  0.1202    mach_learn: pred_not  0.0615  0.8183  0.8798    Total  0.1696  0.8304  1.00      Joint probability distribution for the photo_classify data set.

Each of the four outcome combinations are disjoint, all probabilities are indeed non-negative, and the sum of the probabilities is .    We can compute marginal probabilities using joint probabilities in simple cases. For example, the probability a randomly selected photo from the data set is about fashion is found by summing the outcomes where truth takes value fashion :     Defining conditional probability  The ML classifier predicts whether a photo is about fashion, even if it is not perfect. We would like to better understand how to use information from a variable like mach_learn to improve our probability estimation of a second variable, which in this example is truth .  The probability that a random photo from the data set is about fashion is about 0.17. If we knew the machine learning classifier predicted the photo was about fashion, could we get a better estimate of the probability the photo is actually about fashion? Absolutely. To do so, we limit our view to only those 219 cases where the ML classifier predicted that the photo was about fashion and look at the fraction where the photo was actually about fashion: We call this a conditional probability because we computed the probability under a condition: the ML classifier prediction said the photo was about fashion.  There are two parts to a conditional probability, the outcome of interest and the condition . It is useful to think of the condition as information we know to be true, and this information usually can be described as a known outcome or event. We generally separate the text inside our probability notation into the outcome of interest and the condition with a vertical bar: The vertical bar is read as given .  In this equation, we computed the probability a photo was about fashion based on the condition that the ML algorithm predicted it was about fashion as a fraction: We considered only those cases that met the condition ( mach_learn is pred_fashion ) and then we computed the ratio of those cases that satisfied our outcome of interest (photo was actually about fashion).  Frequently, marginal and joint probabilities are provided instead of count data. For example, disease rates are commonly listed in percentages rather than in a count format. We would like to be able to compute conditional probabilities even when no counts are available, and we use the previous equation as a template to understand this technique.  If we were provided only the information in , i.e. only probability data, then if we took a sample of 1000 photos, we would anticipate about 12.0% or would be predicted to be about fashion. Similarly, we would expect about 10.8% or to meet both the information criteria and represent our outcome of interest. Then the conditional probability can be computed as: Here we are examining exactly the fraction of two probabilities, 0.108 and 0.120, which we can write as: The fraction of these probabilities is an example of the general formula for conditional probability.   Conditional probability  The conditional probability of outcome given condition is computed as:      (a) Write out the following statement in conditional probability notation: The probability that the ML prediction was correct, if the photo was about fashion . Here the condition is now based on the photo's truth status, not the ML algorithm. (b) Determine the probability from part (a). may be helpful.    (a) (b) The equation for conditional probability indicates we should first find and . Then the ratio represents the conditional probability: .      (a) Determine the probability that the algorithm is incorrect if it is known the photo is about fashion. (b) Using part (a) and the previous exercise, compute the sum of the two conditional probabilities. (c) Provide an intuitive argument to explain why this sum is 1.    (a) (b) The total equals 1. (c) Under the condition the photo is about fashion, the ML algorithm must have either predicted it was about fashion or predicted it was not about fashion. The complement still works for conditional probabilities, provided the probabilities are conditioned on the same information.      Smallpox in Boston, 1721  The smallpox data set provides a sample of 6,224 individuals from the year 1721 who were exposed to smallpox in Boston. Doctors at the time believed that inoculation, which involves exposing a person to the disease in a controlled form, could reduce the likelihood of death.  Each case represents one person with two variables: inoculated and result . The variable inoculated takes two levels: yes or no , indicating whether the person was inoculated or not. The variable result has outcomes lived or died . These data are summarized in and .   Contingency table for the smallpox data set.     inoculated      yes  no  Total    lived  238  5136  5374    died  6  844  850    Total  244  5980  6224      Table proportions for the smallpox data, computed by dividing each count by the table total, 6224.     inoculated      yes  no  Total    lived  0.0382  0.8252  0.8634    died  0.0010  0.1356  0.1366    Total  0.0392  0.9608  1.0000       Write out, in formal notation, the probability a randomly selected person who was not inoculated died from smallpox, and find this probability.           Determine the probability that an inoculated person died from smallpox. How does this result compare with the previous exercise?     (If we avoided rounding errors, we'd get ). The death rate for individuals who were inoculated is only about 1 in 40 while the death rate is about 1 in 7 for those who were not inoculated.      The people of Boston self-selected whether or not to be inoculated. (a) Is this study observational or was this an experiment? (b) Can we infer any causal connection using these data? (c) What are some potential confounding variables that might influence whether someone lived or died and also affect whether that person was inoculated?    Brief answers: (a) Observational. (b) No, we cannot infer causation from this observational study. (c) Accessibility to the latest and best medical care. There are other valid answers for part (c).      General multiplication rule  Section 3.1 on Independence introduced the Multiplication Rule for independent processes. Here we provide the General Multiplication Rule for events that might not be independent.   General Multiplication Rule  If and represent two outcomes or events, then It is useful to think of as the outcome of interest and as the condition.   This General Multiplication Rule is simply a rearrangement of the conditional probability equation.    Consider the smallpox data set. Suppose we are given only two pieces of information: 96.08% of residents were not inoculated, and 85.88% of the residents who were not inoculated ended up surviving. How could we compute the probability that a resident was not inoculated and lived?    We will compute our answer using the General Multiplication Rule and then verify it using . We want to determine and we are given that and .  Among the 96.08% of people who were not inoculated, 85.88% survived: This is equivalent to the General Multiplication Rule. We can confirm this probability in at the intersection of no and lived (with a small rounding error).      Use and to determine the probability that a person was both inoculated and lived.    The answer is 0.0382, which can be verified using .      If 97.54% of the inoculated people lived, what proportion of inoculated people must have died?    There were only two possible outcomes: lived or died. This means that of the people who were inoculated died.     Sum of conditional probabilities  Let represent all the disjoint outcomes for a variable or process. Then if is an event, possibly for another variable or process, we have: The rule for complements also holds when an event and its complement are conditioned on the same information:      Based on the probabilities computed above, does it appear that inoculation is effective at reducing the risk of death from smallpox?    The samples are large relative to the difference in death rates for the inoculated and not inoculated groups, so it seems there is an association between inoculated and result . However, this is an observational study and we cannot be sure if there is a causal connection. (Further research has shown that inoculation is effective at reducing death rates.)      Independence considerations in conditional probability  If two events are independent, then knowing the outcome of one should provide no information about the other. We can show this is mathematically true using conditional probabilities.    Let and represent the outcomes of rolling two dice.    What is the probability that the first die, , is 1?  What is the probability that both and are 1?  Use the formula for conditional probability to compute .  What is ? Is this different from the answer from part (c)? Explain.      Brief solutions: (a) . (b) . (c) . (d) The probability is the same as in part (c): . The probability that was unchanged by knowledge about , which makes sense as and are independent.    We can show in the above exercise that the conditioning information has no influence by using the Multiplication Rule for independence processes:     Ron is watching a roulette table in a casino and notices that the last five outcomes were black. He figures that the chances of getting black six times in a row is very small (about 1\/64) and puts his paycheck on red. What is wrong with his reasoning?    He has forgotten that the next roulette spin is independent of the previous spins. This fallacy, known as the gambler's fallacy , is commonly exploited by casinos which post the last several outcomes of betting games.      Tree diagrams   Tree diagrams are a tool to organize outcomes and probabilities around the structure of the data. They are most useful when two or more processes occur in a sequence and each process is conditioned on its predecessors.  The smallpox data fit this description. We see the population as split by inoculation : yes and no. Following this split, survival rates were observed for each group. This structure is reflected in the tree diagram shown in .   A tree diagram of the smallpox data set.    Tree diagrams are annotated with marginal and conditional probabilities. This tree diagram splits the smallpox data by inoculation into the yes and no groups with respective marginal probabilities 0.0392 and 0.9608. The secondary branches are conditioned on the first, so we assign conditional probabilities to these branches. We may construct joint probabilities at the end of each branch in our tree by multiplying the numbers we come across as we move from left to right. These joint probabilities are computed using the General Multiplication Rule:     Consider the midterm and final for a statistics class. Suppose 13% of students earned an A on the midterm. Of those students who earned an A on the midterm, 47% received an A on the final, and 11% of the students who earned lower than an A on the midterm received an A on the final. You randomly pick up a final exam and notice the student received an A. What is the probability that this student earned an A on the midterm?    The end-goal is to find . To calculate this conditional probability, we need and . Since we aren't sure how to proceed, it is useful to organize the information into a tree diagram (shown below).     Variables provided with marginal probabilities are often used to create the tree's primary branches; in this case, the marginal probabilities are provided for midterm grades. The final grades, which correspond to the conditional probabilities provided, will be shown on the secondary branches.  With the tree diagram constructed, we may compute the required probabilities: The marginal probability was calculated by adding up all the joint probabilities corresponding to final = A. We may now take the ratio of the two probabilities: The probability the student also earned an A on the midterm is about 0.39.      After an introductory statistics course, 78% of students can successfully construct tree diagrams. Of those who can construct tree diagrams, 97% passed, while only 57% of those students who could not construct tree diagrams passed. (a) Organize this information into a tree diagram. (b) What is the probability that a randomly selected student passed? (c) Compute the probability a student is able to construct a tree diagram if it is known that she passed.    (a) The tree diagram is provided below. (b) Identify which two joint probabilities represent students who passed, and add them: . (c) .         Bayes' Theorem  In many instances, we are given a conditional probability of the form but we would really like to know the inverted conditional probability: . Tree diagrams can be used to find the second conditional probability when given the first. However, sometimes it is not possible to draw the scenario in a tree diagram. In these cases, we can apply a very useful and general formula: Bayes' Theorem.    In Canada, about 0.35% of women over 40 will develop breast cancer in any given year. A common screening test for cancer is the mammogram, but this test is not perfect. In about 11% of patients with breast cancer, the test gives a false negative : it indicates a woman does not have breast cancer when she does have breast cancer. Similarly, the test gives a false positive in 7% of patients who do not have breast cancer: it indicates these patients have breast cancer when they actually do not. If we tested a random woman over 40 for breast cancer using a mammogram and the test came back positive — that is, the test suggested the patient has cancer — what is the probability that the patient actually has breast cancer?    Notice that we are given sufficient information to quickly compute the probability of testing positive if a woman has breast cancer ( ). However, we seek the inverted probability of cancer given a positive test result.  This inverted probability can be broken into two pieces:   We can construct a tree diagram to organize these probabilities:     The probability the patient has breast cancer and the mammogram is positive is:   The probability of a positive test result is the sum of the two corresponding scenarios:   Then if the mammogram screening is positive for a patient, the probability the patient has breast cancer is: That is, even if a patient has a positive mammogram screening, there is still only about a 4% chance that she has breast cancer.     highlights why doctors often run more tests regardless of a first positive test result. When a medical condition is rare, a single positive test isn't generally definitive.  Consider again the last equation of . Using the tree diagram, we can see that the numerator is: The denominator—the probability the screening was positive—is the sum of probabilities for each positive screening scenario:    Bayes' Theorem: inverting probabilities  Consider the following conditional probability for variable 1 and variable 2: Bayes' Theorem states that this conditional probability can be identified as: where represent all other possible outcomes of the first variable.   Bayes' Theorem is a generalization of what we have done using tree diagrams. The numerator identifies the probability of getting both and . The denominator is the marginal probability of getting . This bottom component of the fraction appears long and complicated since we have to add up probabilities from all of the different ways to get . We always completed this step when using tree diagrams. However, we usually did it in a separate step so it didn't seem as complex.  To apply Bayes' Theorem correctly, there are two preparatory steps:    First identify the marginal probabilities of each possible outcome of the first variable: .  Then identify the probability of the outcome , conditioned on each possible scenario for the first variable: .    Once each of these probabilities are identified, they can be applied directly within the formula. Bayes' Theorem tends to be a good option when there are so many scenarios that drawing a tree diagram would be complex.    Jose visits campus every Thursday evening. However, some days the parking garage is full, often due to college events. There are academic events on 35% of evenings, sporting events on 20% of evenings, and no events on 45% of evenings. When there is an academic event, the garage fills up about 25% of the time, and it fills up 70% of evenings with sporting events. On evenings when there are no events, it only fills up about 5% of the time. If Jose comes to campus and finds the garage full, what is the probability that there is a sporting event? Use a tree diagram to solve this problem.    The tree diagram with three primary branches is shown below. Next, we identify two probabilities from the tree diagram: (1) The probability that there is a sporting event and the garage is full: 0.14. (2) The probability the garage is full: . Then the solution is the ratio of these probabilities: . If the garage is full, there is a 56% probability that there is a sporting event.         Here we solve the same problem presented in the previous exercise, except this time we use Bayes' Theorem.    The outcome of interest is whether there is a sporting event (call this ), and the condition is that the lot is full ( ). Let represent an academic event and represent there being no event on campus. Then the given probabilities can be written as:   Bayes' Theorem can be used to compute the probability of a sporting event ( ) under the condition that the parking lot is full ( ): Based on the information that the garage is full, there is a 56% probability that a sporting event is being held on campus that evening.      Use the information in and to verify the probability that there is an academic event conditioned on the parking lot being full is 0.35.    Short answer:       In and , you found that if the parking lot is full, the probability there is a sporting event is 0.56 and the probability there is an academic event is 0.35. Using this information, compute .    Each probability is conditioned on the same information that the garage is full, so the complement may be used: .    The last several exercises offered a way to update our belief about whether there is a sporting event, academic event, or no event going on at the school based on the information that the parking lot was full. This strategy of updating beliefs using Bayes' Theorem is actually the foundation of an entire section of statistics called Bayesian statistics . While Bayesian statistics is very important and useful, we will not have time to cover much more of it in this book.   "

  "body": " Sampling from a small population   When we sample observations from a population, usually we're only sampling a small fraction of the possible individuals or cases. However, sometimes our sample size is large enough or the population is small enough that we sample more than 10% of a population without replacement (meaning we do not have a chance of sampling the same cases twice). Sampling such a notable fraction of a population can be important for how we analyze the sample.    Selecting a student at random   Professors sometimes select a student at random to answer a question. If each student has an equal chance of being selected and there are 15 people in your class, what is the chance that she will pick you for the next question?    If there are 15 people to ask and none are skipping class, then the probability is , or about 0.067.     Three questions without replacement   If the professor asks 3 questions, what is the probability that you will not be selected? Assume that she will not pick the same person twice in a given lecture.    For the first question, she will pick someone else with probability . When she asks the second question, she only has 14 people who have not yet been asked. Thus, if you were not picked on the first question, the probability you are again not picked is . Similarly, the probability you are again not picked on the third question is , and the probability of not being picked for any of the three questions is       What rule permitted us to multiply the probabilities in ?    The three probabilities we computed were actually one marginal probability, , and two conditional probabilities: Using the General Multiplication Rule, the product of these three probabilities is the probability of not being picked in 3 questions.     Three questions with replacement   Suppose the professor randomly picks without regard to who she already selected, i.e. students can be picked more than once. What is the probability that you will not be picked for any of the three questions?    Each pick is independent, and the probability of not being picked for any individual question is . Thus, we can use the Multiplication Rule for independent processes. You have a slightly higher chance of not being picked compared to when she picked a new person for each question. However, you now may be picked more than once.      Under the setup of , what is the probability of being picked to answer all three questions?         If we sample from a small population without replacement, we no longer have independence between our observations. In , the probability of not being picked for the second question was conditioned on the event that you were not picked for the first question. In , the professor sampled her students with replacement: she repeatedly sampled the entire class without regard to who she already picked.    Your department is holding a raffle. They sell 30 tickets and offer seven prizes.  They place the tickets in a hat and draw one for each prize. The tickets are sampled without replacement, i.e. the selected tickets are not placed back in the hat. What is the probability of winning a prize if you buy one ticket?  What if the tickets are sampled with replacement?      (a) First determine the probability of not winning. The tickets are sampled without replacement, which means the probability you do not win on the first draw is , for the second, , and for the seventh. The probability you win no prize is the product of these separate probabilities: . That is, the probability of winning a prize is .  (b) When the tickets are sampled with replacement, there are seven independent draws. Again we first find the probability of not winning a prize: . Thus, the probability of winning (at least) one prize when drawing with replacement is 0.211.      Compare your answers in . How much influence does the sampling method have on your chances of winning a prize?    There is about a 10% larger chance of winning a prize when using sampling without replacement. However, at most one prize may be won under this sampling procedure.    Had we repeated with 300 tickets instead of 30, we would have found something interesting: the results would be nearly identical. The probability would be 0.0233 without replacement and 0.0231 with replacement. When the sample size is only a small fraction of the population (under 10%), observations are nearly independent even when sampling without replacement.  "

  "title": "Random variables",
  "body": " Random variables   It's often useful to model a process using what's called a random variable . Such a model allows us to apply a mathematical framework and statistical principles for better understanding and predicting outcomes in the real world.    Bookstore sales expectation   Two books are assigned for a statistics class: a textbook and its corresponding study guide. The university bookstore determined 20% of enrolled students do not buy either book, 55% buy the textbook only, and 25% buy both books. If there are 100 students enrolled, how many books should the bookstore expect to sell to this class?    Around 20 students will not buy either book (0 books total), about 55 will buy one book (55 books total), and approximately 25 will buy two books (totaling 50 books for these 25 students). The bookstore should expect to sell about 105 books for this class.      Would you be surprised if the bookstore sold slightly more or less than 105 books?    If they sell a little more or a little less, this should not be a surprise. There is natural variability in observed data. For example, if we flip a coin 100 times, it will not usually come up heads exactly half the time, but it will probably be close.     Expectation  We call a variable or process with a numerical outcome a random variable , and we usually represent this random variable with a capital letter such as , , or . The amount of money a single student will spend on her statistics books is a random variable, and we represent it by .   Random variable  A random process or variable with a numerical outcome.   The possible outcomes of are labeled with a corresponding lower case letter and subscripts. For example, we write , , and , which occur with probabilities 0.20, 0.55, and 0.25. The distribution of is summarized in the table below.   The probability distribution for the random variable , representing the bookstore's revenue from a single student.     1  2  3  Total     $0  $137  $170  --     0.20  0.55  0.25  1.00      Probability distribution for the bookstore's revenue from one student. The triangle represents the average revenue per student.      What is the average revenue per student for this course?    The expected total revenue is $11,785, and there are 100 students. Therefore the expected revenue per student is .    We computed the average outcome of as in . We call this average the expected value of , denoted by . The expected value of a random variable is computed by adding each outcome weighted by its probability:    Expected value of a discrete random variable  If takes outcomes with probabilities , the expected value of is the sum of each outcome multiplied by its corresponding probability: The Greek letter may be used in place of the notation .   The expected value for a random variable represents the average outcome. For example, represents the average amount the bookstore expects to make from a single student, which we could also write as .  It is also possible to compute the expected value of a continuous random variable (see ). However, it requires calculus and we save it for a later class.  In physics, the expectation holds the same meaning as the center of gravity. The distribution can be represented by a series of weights at each outcome, and the mean represents the balancing point.    Variability in random variables  Suppose you ran the university bookstore. Besides how much revenue you expect to generate, you might also want to know the volatility (variability) in your revenue.  The variance and standard deviation can be used to describe the variability of a random variable. We first compute deviations from the mean ( ), square those deviations, and take an average to get the variance. In the case of a random variable, we again compute squared deviations. However, we take their sum weighted by their corresponding probabilities, just like we did for the expectation. This weighted sum of squared deviations equals the variance, and we calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance.   Variance of a discrete random variable  If takes outcomes with probabilities and expected value , then the variance of , denoted by or the symbol , is The standard deviation of , labeled , is the square root of the variance.     Compute the expected value, variance, and standard deviation of , the revenue of a single statistics student for the bookstore.    It is useful to construct a table that holds computations for each outcome separately, then add up the results.      1  2  3  Total     $0  $137  $170      0.20  0.55  0.25      0  75.35  42.50  117.85     Thus, the expected value is , which we computed earlier. The variance can be constructed by extending this table:      1  2  3  Total     $0  $137  $170      0.20  0.55  0.25      0  75.35  42.50  117.85     -117.85  19.15  52.15      13888.62  366.72  2719.62      2777.7  201.7  679.9  3659.3     The variance of is , which means the standard deviation is .      The bookstore also offers a chemistry textbook for $159 and a book supplement for $41. From past experience, they know about 25% of chemistry students just buy the textbook while 60% buy both the textbook and supplement.    What proportion of students don't buy either book? Assume no students buy the supplement without the textbook.  Let represent the revenue from a single student. Write out the probability distribution of , i.e. a table for each outcome and its associated probability.  Compute the expected revenue from a single chemistry student.  Find the standard deviation to describe the variability associated with the revenue from a single student.      (a) of students do not buy any books for the class.  (b) The probability distribution is represented in the table below.  (c) The expectation is given as the total on the line : .  (d) The result is the square root of the variance listed in the total on the last line: .      1  2  3  Total    Scenario  no book  textbook  both      0.00  159.00  200.00      0.15  0.25  0.60      0.00  39.75  120.00  159.75     -159.75  -0.75  40.25      25520.06  0.56  1620.06      3828.0  0.1  972.0          Linear combinations of random variables  So far, we have thought of each variable as being a complete story in and of itself. Sometimes it is more appropriate to use a combination of variables. For instance, the amount of time a person spends commuting to work each week can be broken down into several daily commutes. Similarly, the total gain or loss in a stock portfolio is the sum of the gains and losses in its components.    John travels to work five days a week. We will use to represent his travel time on Monday, to represent his travel time on Tuesday, and so on. Write an equation using that represents his travel time for the week, denoted by .    His total weekly travel time is the sum of the five daily values: Breaking the weekly travel time into pieces provides a framework for understanding each source of randomness and is useful for modeling .      It takes John an average of 18 minutes each day to commute to work. What would you expect his average commute time to be for the week?    We were told that the average (i.e. expected value) of the commute time is 18 minutes per day: . To get the expected time for the sum of the five days, we can add up the expected time for each individual day: The expectation of the total time is equal to the sum of the expected individual times. More generally, the expectation of a sum of random variables is always the sum of the expectation for each random variable.      Elena is selling a TV at a cash auction and also intends to buy a toaster oven in the auction. If represents the profit for selling the TV and represents the cost of the toaster oven, write an equation that represents the net change in Elena's cash.    She will make dollars on the TV but spend dollars on the toaster oven: .      Based on past auctions, Elena figures she should expect to make about $175 on the TV and pay about $23 for the toaster oven. In total, how much should she expect to make or spend?     . She should expect to make about $152.      Would you be surprised if John's weekly commute wasn't exactly 90 minutes or if Elena didn't make exactly $152? Explain.    No, since there is probably some variability. For example, the traffic will vary from one day to next, and auction prices will vary depending on the quality of the merchandise and the interest of the attendees.    Two important concepts concerning combinations of random variables have so far been introduced. First, a final value can sometimes be described as the sum of its parts in an equation. Second, intuition suggests that putting the individual average values into this equation gives the average value we would expect in total. This second point needs clarification -- it is guaranteed to be true in what are called linear combinations of random variables .  A linear combination of two random variables and is a combination where and are some fixed and known numbers. For John's commute time, there were five random variables -- one for each work day -- and each random variable could be written as having a fixed coefficient of 1: For Elena's net gain or loss, the random variable had a coefficient of +1 and the random variable had a coefficient of -1.  When considering the average of a linear combination of random variables, it is safe to plug in the mean of each random variable and then compute the final result. For some examples of nonlinear combinations of random variables -- cases where we cannot simply plug in the means -- consider: , , . In such cases, plugging in the average value for each random variable and computing the result will not generally lead to an accurate average value for the end result.   Linear combinations of random variables and the average result  If and are random variables, then a linear combination of the random variables is given by where and are some fixed numbers. To compute the average value of a linear combination of random variables, plug in the average of each individual random variable and compute the result: Recall that the expected value is the same as the mean, e.g. .     Leonard has invested $6000 in Caterpillar Inc (stock ticker: CAT) and $2000 in Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM). If represents the change in Caterpillar's stock next month and represents the change in Exxon Mobil's stock next month, write an equation that describes how much money will be made or lost in Leonard's stocks for the month.    For simplicity, we will suppose and are not in percents but are in decimal form (e.g. if Caterpillar's stock increases 1%, then ; or if it loses 1%, then ). Then we can write an equation for Leonard's gain as If we plug in the change in the stock value for and , this equation gives the change in value of Leonard's stock portfolio for the month. A positive value represents a gain, and a negative value represents a loss.      Caterpillar stock has recently been rising at 2.0% and Exxon Mobil's at 0.2% per month, respectively. Compute the expected change in Leonard's stock portfolio for next month.           You should have found that Leonard expects a positive gain in . However, would you be surprised if he actually had a loss this month?    No. While stocks tend to rise over time, they are often volatile in the short term.    Quantifying the average outcome from a linear combination of random variables is helpful, but it is also important to have some sense of the uncertainty associated with the total outcome of that combination of random variables. The expected net gain or loss of Leonard's stock portfolio was considered in . However, there was no quantitative discussion of the volatility of this portfolio.   The change in a portfolio like Leonard's for 36 months, where $6000 is in Caterpillar's stock and $2000 is in Exxon Mobil's.    For instance, while the average monthly gain might be about $124 according to the data, that gain is not guaranteed. The figure shows the monthly changes in a portfolio like Leonard's during a three year period. The gains and losses vary widely, and quantifying these fluctuations is important when investing in stocks.  Just as we have done in many previous cases, we use the variance and standard deviation to describe the uncertainty associated with Leonard's monthly returns. The variance of a linear combination of random variables can be computed by plugging in the variances of the individual random variables and squaring the coefficients of the random variables. This equation is valid as long as the random variables are independent.   Variability of linear combinations of random variables  The variance of a linear combination of random variables may be computed by squaring the constants, substituting in the variances for the random variables, and computing the result: This equation is valid as long as the random variables are independent of each other. The standard deviation of the linear combination may be found by taking the square root of the variance.     Suppose John's daily commute has a standard deviation of 4 minutes. What is the uncertainty in his total commute time for the week?    The expression for John's commute time was Each coefficient is 1, and the variance of each day's time is . Thus, the variance of the total weekly commute time is The standard deviation for John's weekly work commute time is about 9 minutes.      The computation in relied on an important assumption: the commute time for each day is independent of the time on other days of that week. Do you think this is valid? Explain.    One concern is whether traffic patterns tend to have a weekly cycle (e.g. Fridays may be worse than other days). If that is the case, and John drives, then the assumption is probably not reasonable. However, if John walks to work, then his commute is probably not affected by any weekly traffic cycle.      Consider Elena's two auctions from . Suppose these auctions are approximately independent and the variability in auction prices associated with the TV and toaster oven can be described using standard deviations of $25 and $8. Compute the standard deviation of Elena's net gain.    The equation for Elena can be written as The variances of and are 625 and 64. We square the coefficients and plug in the variances: The variance of the linear combination is 689, and the standard deviation is the square root of 689: about $26.25.    Consider again . The negative coefficient for in the linear combination was eliminated when we squared the coefficients. This generally holds true: negatives in a linear combination will have no impact on the variability computed for a linear combination, but they do impact the expected value computations.   "

Four hollow histograms of US adults heights with varying bin widths     Probability from histogram   What proportion of the sample is between 180 cm and 185 cm tall (about 5'11\" to 6'1\")?    We can add up the heights of the bins in the range 180 cm and 185 cm and divide by the sample size. For instance, this can be done with the two shaded bins shown in . The two bins in this region have counts of 195,307 and 156,239 people, resulting in the following estimate of the probability: This fraction is the same as the proportion of the histogram's area that falls in the range 180 to 185 cm.

From histograms to continuous distributions  Examine the transition from a boxy hollow histogram in the top-left of to the much smoother plot in the lower-right. In this last plot, the bins are so slim that the hollow histogram is starting to resemble a smooth curve. This suggests the population height as a continuous numerical variable might best be explained by a curve that represents the outline of extremely slim bins.  This smooth curve represents a probability density function (also called a density or distribution ), and such a curve is shown in overlaid on a histogram of the sample.

Probabilities from continuous distributions  We computed the proportion of individuals with heights 180 to 185 cm in as a fraction: We found the number of people with heights between 180 and 185 cm by determining the fraction of the histogram's area in this region. Similarly, we can use the area in the shaded region under the curve to find a probability (with the help of a computer): The probability that a randomly selected person is between 180 and 185 cm is 0.1157. This is very close to the estimate from : 0.1172.   Density for heights in the US adult population with the area between 180 and 185 cm shaded. Compare this plot with .

Indeed it is so common, that people often know it as the normal curve or normal distribution.   A normal curve    Variables such as SAT scores and heights of US adult males closely follow the normal distribution.    Normal distribution model  The normal distribution always describes a symmetric, unimodal, bell-shaped curve. However, these curves can look different depending on the details of the model. Specifically, the normal distribution model can be adjusted using two parameters: mean and standard deviation. As you can probably guess, changing the mean shifts the bell curve to the left or right, while changing the standard deviation stretches or constricts the curve. shows the normal distribution with mean and standard deviation in the left panel and the normal distribution with mean and standard deviation in the right panel. shows these distributions on the same axis.   Both curves represent the normal distribution. However, they differ in their center and spread.     The normal distributions shown in but plotted together and on the same scale.    If a normal distribution has mean and standard deviation , we may write the distribution as . The two distributions in may be written as Because the mean and standard deviation describe a normal distribution exactly, they are called the distribution's parameters .    Normal distribution facts   Many variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal. Thus the normal distribution, while not perfect for any single problem, is very useful for a variety of problems. We will use it in data exploration and to solve important problems in statistics.   The normal distribution with mean and standard deviation is called the standard normal distribution .    Write down the short-hand for a normal distribution with (a) mean 5 and standard deviation 3, (b) mean -100 and standard deviation 10, and (c) mean 2 and standard deviation 9.    (a) . (b) . (c) .      Standardizing with Z-scores  We often want to put data onto a standardized scale, which can make comparisons more reasonable.   Comparing SAT and ACT scores    shows the mean and standard deviation for total scores on the SAT and ACT. The distribution of SAT and ACT scores are both nearly normal. Suppose Ann scored 1300 on her SAT and Tom scored 24 on his ACT. Who performed better?    We use the standard deviation as a guide. Ann is 1 standard deviation above average on the SAT: . Tom is 0.5 standard deviations above the mean on the ACT: . In , we can see that Ann tends to do better with respect to everyone else than Tom did, so her score was better.     Mean and standard deviation for the SAT and ACT     SAT  ACT    Mean  1100  21    SD  200  6      Ann's and Tom's scores shown against the SAT and ACT distributions.     used a standardization technique called a Z-score, a method most commonly employed for nearly normal observations but that may be used with any distribution. The Z-score of an observation is defined as the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. If the observation is one standard deviation above the mean, its Z-score is 1. If it is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean, then its Z-score is -1.5. If is an observation from a distribution , we define the Z-score mathematically as Using , , and , we find Ann's Z-score:     The Z-score   The Z-score of an observation is the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. We compute the Z-score for an observation that follows a distribution with mean and standard deviation using      Use Tom's ACT score, 24, along with the ACT mean and standard deviation to find his Z-score.         Observations above the mean always have positive Z-scores, while those below the mean always have negative Z-scores. If an observation is equal to the mean, such as an SAT score of 1100, then the Z-score is .    Let represent a random variable from , and suppose we observe . (a) Find the Z-score of . (b) Use the Z-score to determine how many standard deviations above or below the mean falls.    (a) Its Z-score is given by . (b) The observation is 1.095 standard deviations above the mean. We know it must be above the mean since is positive.      Head lengths of brushtail possums follow a normal distribution with mean 92.6 mm and standard deviation 3.6 mm. Compute the Z-scores for possums with head lengths of 95.4 mm and 85.8 mm.    For mm: . For mm: .    We can use Z-scores to roughly identify which observations are more unusual than others. An observation is said to be more unusual than another observation if the absolute value of its Z-score is larger than the absolute value of the other observation's Z-score: . This technique is especially insightful when a distribution is symmetric.    Which of the observations in is more unusual?    Because the absolute value of Z-score for the second observation is larger than that of the first, the second observation has a more unusual head length.      Finding tail areas  It's very useful in statistics to be able to identify tail areas of distributions. For instance, what fraction of people have an SAT score below Ann's score of 1300? This is the same as the percentile Ann is at, which is the percentage of cases that have lower scores than Ann. We can visualize such a tail area like the curve and shading shown in .   The area to the left of represents the fraction of people who scored lower than Ann.    There are many techniques for doing this, and we'll discuss three of the options.   The most common approach in practice is to use statistical software. For example, in the program R, we could find the area shown in using the following command, which takes in the Z-score and returns the lower tail area: pnorm(1) returns 0.8413447 . According to this calculation, the region shaded that is below 1300 represents the proportion 0.841 (84.1%) of SAT test takers who had Z-scores below . More generally, we can also specify the cutoff explicitly if we also note the mean and standard deviation: pnorm(1300, mean = 1100, sd = 200) returns 0.8413447 .  There are many other software options, such as Python or SAS; even spreadsheet programs such as Excel and Google Sheets support these calculations.    A common strategy in classrooms is to use a graphing calculator, such as a TI or Casio calculator. These calculators require a series of button presses that are less concisely described. You can find instructions on using these calculators for finding tail areas of a normal distribution in the OpenIntro video library: .    The last option for finding tail areas is to use what's called a probability table ; these are occasionally used in classrooms but rarely in practice. The appendix contains such a table and a guide for how to use it.     We will solve normal distribution problems in this section by always first finding the Z-score. The reason is that we will encounter close parallels called test statistics beginning in Chapter 5; these are, in many instances, an equivalent of a Z-score.    Normal probability examples  Cumulative SAT scores are approximated well by a normal model, .   Finding probability of SAT score above 1190   Shannon is a randomly selected SAT taker, and nothing is known about Shannon's SAT aptitude. What is the probability Shannon scores at least 1190 on her SATs?    First, always draw and label a picture of the normal distribution. (Drawings need not be exact to be useful.) We are interested in the chance she scores above 1190, so we shade this upper tail:   Shading the upper tail above 1190    The picture shows the mean and the values at 2 standard deviations above and below the mean. The simplest way to find the shaded area under the curve makes use of the Z-score of the cutoff value. With , , and the cutoff value , the Z-score is computed as Using statistical software (or another preferred method), we can find the area left of as 0.6736. To find the area above  , we compute one minus the area of the lower tail:   Computing the upper tail area    The probability Shannon scores at least 1190 on the SAT is 0.3264.      Always draw a picture first, and find the Z-score second   For any normal probability situation, always always always draw and label the normal curve and shade the area of interest first. The picture will provide an estimate of the probability. After drawing a figure to represent the situation, identify the Z-score for the value of interest.     If the probability of Shannon scoring at least 1190 is 0.3264, then what is the probability she scores less than 1190? Draw the normal curve representing this exercise, shading the lower region instead of the upper one.    We found this probability in : 0.6736.     Finding a percentile   Edward earned a 1030 on his SAT. What is his percentile?    First, a picture is needed. Edward's percentile is the proportion of people who do not get as high as a 1030. These are the scores to the left of 1030.   Shading the lower tail below 1030    Identifying the mean , the standard deviation , and the cutoff for the tail area makes it easy to compute the Z-score: Using statistical software, we get a tail area of 0.3632. Edward is at the 36 percentile.      Use the results of to compute the proportion of SAT takers who did better than Edward. Also draw a new picture.    If Edward did better than 36% of SAT takers, then about 64% must have done better than him.      Finding areas to the right   Many software programs return the area to the left when given a Z-score. If you would like the area to the right, first find the area to the left and then subtract this amount from one.     Stuart earned an SAT score of 1500. Draw a picture for each part. (a) What is his percentile? (b) What percent of SAT takers did better than Stuart?    We leave the drawings to you. (a) . (b) .    Based on a sample of 100 men, the heights of male adults in the US is nearly normal with mean 70.0'' and standard deviation 3.3''.    Mike is 5'7'' and Jose is 6'4'', and they both live in the US. (a) What is Mike's height percentile? (b) What is Jose's height percentile? Also draw one picture for each part.    First put the heights into inches: 67 and 76 inches. (a) . (b) .    The last several problems have focused on finding the percentile (lower tail) or the upper tail for a particular observation. What if you would like to know the observation corresponding to a particular percentile?   Finding height at 40th percentile   Erik's height is at the 40 percentile. How tall is he?    As always, first draw the picture.   Finding the height at the 40th percentile    In this case, the lower tail probability is known (0.40), which can be shaded on the diagram. We want to find the observation that corresponds to this value. As a first step in this direction, we determine the Z-score associated with the 40 percentile. Using software, we can obtain the corresponding Z-score of about -0.25.  Knowing and the population parameters and inches, the Z-score formula can be set up to determine Erik's unknown height, labeled : Solving for yields a height of 69.18 inches. That is, Erik is about 5'9''.     Finding height at 82nd percentile   What is the adult male height at the 82 percentile?    Again, we draw the figure first.   Finding the height at the 82nd percentile    Next, we want to find the Z-score at the 82 percentile, which will be a positive value and can be found using software as . Finally, the height is found using the Z-score formula with the known mean , standard deviation , and Z-score : This yields 73.04 inches or about 6'1'' as the height at the 82 percentile.      The SAT scores follow . (a) What is the 95 percentile for SAT scores? (b) What is the 97.5 percentile for SAT scores?    Short answers: (a) SAT score. (b) SAT score.      Adult male heights follow . (a) What is the probability that a randomly selected male adult is at least 6'2'' (74 inches)? (b) What is the probability that a male adult is shorter than 5'9'' (69 inches)?    Short answers: (a) , then subtract this value from 1 to get 0.1131. (b) .     Finding probability between two values   What is the probability that a random adult male is between 5'9'' and 6'2''?    These heights correspond to 69 inches and 74 inches. First, draw the figure. The area of interest is no longer an upper or lower tail.   Finding area between two values    The total area under the curve is 1. If we find the area of the two tails that are not shaded (from , these areas are 0.3821 and 0.1131), then we can find the middle area:   Subtracting the tail areas from 1    That is, the probability of being between 5'9'' and 6'2'' is 0.5048.      SAT scores follow . What percent of SAT takers get between 1100 and 1400?    This is an abbreviated solution. (Be sure to draw a figure!) First find the percent who get below 1100 and the percent that get above 1400: (area below), (area above). Final answer: .      Adult male heights follow . What percent of adult males are between 5'5'' and 5'7''?    5'5'' is 65 inches ( ). 5'7'' is 67 inches ( ). Numerical solution: , i.e. 11.71%.      68-95-99.7 rule  Here, we present a useful rule of thumb for the probability of falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution. This will be useful in a wide range of practical settings, especially when trying to make a quick estimate without a calculator or Z-table.   Probabilities for falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution.      Use software, a calculator, or a probability table to confirm that about 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of observations fall within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution, respectively. For instance, first find the area that falls between and , which should have an area of about 0.68. Similarly there should be an area of about 0.95 between and .    First draw the pictures. Using software, we get 0.6827 within 1 standard deviation, 0.9545 within 2 standard deviations, and 0.9973 within 3 standard deviations.    It is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4, 5, or even more standard deviations from the mean. However, these occurrences are very rare if the data are nearly normal. The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the mean is about 1-in-15,000. For 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-2 million and 1-in-500 million, respectively.    SAT scores closely follow the normal model with mean and standard deviation . (a) About what percent of test takers score 700 to 1500? (b) What percent score between 1100 and 1500?    (a) 700 and 1500 represent two standard deviations below and above the mean, which means about 95% of test takers will score between 700 and 1500. (b) We found that 700 to 1500 represents about 95% of test takers. These test takers would be evenly split by the center of the distribution, 1100, so of all test takers score between 1100 and 1500.      Exercises   Area under the curve, Part I   What percent of a standard normal distribution is found in each region? Be sure to draw a graph.             Area under the curve, Part II   What percent of a standard normal distribution is found in each region? Be sure to draw a graph.             GRE scores, Part I   Sophia who took the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scored 160 on the Verbal Reasoning section and 157 on the Quantitative Reasoning section. The mean score for Verbal Reasoning section for all test takers was 151 with a standard deviation of 7, and the mean score for the Quantitative Reasoning was 153 with a standard deviation of 7.67. Suppose that both distributions are nearly normal.    Write down the short-hand for these two normal distributions.   What is Sophia's Z-score on the Verbal Reasoning section? On the Quantitative Reasoning section? Draw a standard normal distribution curve and mark these two Z-scores.   What do these Z-scores tell you?  Relative to others, which section did she do better on?  Find her percentile scores for the two exams.   What percent of the test takers did better than her on the Verbal Reasoning section? On the Quantitative Reasoning section?    Explain why simply comparing raw scores from the two sections could lead to an incorrect conclusion as to which section a student did better on.    If the distributions of the scores on these exams are not nearly normal, would your answers to parts (b) - (f) change? Explain your reasoning.        Triathlon times, Part I   In triathlons, it is common for racers to be placed into age and gender groups. Friends Leo and Mary both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon, where Leo competed in the Men, Ages 30 - 34 group while Mary competed in the Women, Ages 25 - 29 group. Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 (4948 seconds), while Mary completed the race in 1:31:53 (5513 seconds). Obviously Leo finished faster, but they are curious about how they did within their respective groups. Can you help them? Here is some information on the performance of their groups:     The finishing times of the Men, Ages 30 - 34 group has a mean of 4313 seconds with a standard deviation of 583 seconds.    The finishing times of the Women, Ages 25 - 29 group has a mean of 5261 seconds with a standard deviation of 807 seconds.    The distributions of finishing times for both groups are approximately normal.     Remember: a better performance corresponds to a faster finish.    Write down the short-hand for these two normal distributions.   What are the Z-scores for Leo's and Mary's finishing times? What do these Z-scores tell you?    Did Leo or Mary rank better in their respective groups? Explain your reasoning.    What percent of the triathletes did Leo finish faster than in his group?    What percent of the triathletes did Mary finish faster than in her group?    If the distributions of finishing times are not nearly normal, would your answers to parts (b)-(e) change? Explain your reasoning.        GRE scores, Part II   In we saw two distributions for GRE scores: for the verbal part of the exam and for the quantitative part. Use this information to compute each of the following:     The score of a student who scored in the 80 percentile on the Quantitative Reasoning section.    The score of a student who scored worse than 70% of the test takers in the Verbal Reasoning section.        Triathlon times, Part II   In we saw two distributions for triathlon times: for Men, Ages 30 - 34 and for the Women, Ages 25 - 29 group. Times are listed in seconds. Use this information to compute each of the following:     The cutoff time for the fastest 5% of athletes in the men's group, i.e. those who took the shortest 5% of time to finish.    The cutoff time for the slowest 10% of athletes in the women's group.        LA weather, Part I   The average daily high temperature in June in LA is 77°F with a standard deviation of 5°F. Suppose that the temperatures in June closely follow a normal distribution.     What is the probability of observing an 83°F temperature or higher in LA during a randomly chosen day in June?    How cool are the coldest 10% of the days (days with lowest high temperature) during June in LA?        CAPM   The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that assumes returns on a portfolio are normally distributed. Suppose a portfolio has an average annual return of 14.7% (i.e. an average gain of 14.7%) with a standard deviation of 33%. A return of 0% means the value of the portfolio doesn't change, a negative return means that the portfolio loses money, and a positive return means that the portfolio gains money.     What percent of years does this portfolio lose money, i.e. have a return less than 0%?    What is the cutoff for the highest 15% of annual returns with this portfolio?        LA weather, Part II    states that average daily high temperature in June in LA is 77°F with a standard deviation of 5°F, and it can be assumed that they follow a normal distribution. We use the following equation to convert °F (Fahrenheit) to °C (Celsius):      Write the probability model for the distribution of temperature in °C in June in LA.    What is the probability of observing a 28°C (which roughly corresponds to 83°F) temperature or higher in June in LA? Calculate using the °C model from part (a).    Did you get the same answer or different answers in part (b) of this question and part (a) of ? Are you surprised? Explain.    Estimate the IQR of the temperatures (in °C) in June in LA.        Find the SD   Cholesterol levels for women aged 20 to 34 follow an approximately normal distribution with mean 185 milligrams per deciliter (mg\/dl). Women with cholesterol levels above 220 mg\/dl are considered to have high cholesterol and about 18.5% of women fall into this category. What is the standard deviation of the distribution of cholesterol levels for women aged 20 to 34?     "

  "body": " Geometric distribution   How long should we expect to flip a coin until it turns up heads? Or how many times should we expect to roll a die until we get a 1? These questions can be answered using the geometric distribution. We first formalize each trial such as a single coin flip or die toss using the Bernoulli distribution, and then we combine these with our tools from probability (Chapter 3) to construct the geometric distribution.    Bernoulli distribution  Many health insurance plans in the United States have a deductible, where the insured individual is responsible for costs up to the deductible, and then the costs above the deductible are shared between the individual and insurance company for the remainder of the year.  Suppose a health insurance company found that 70% of the people they insure stay below their deductible in any given year. Each of these people can be thought of as a trial . We label a person a success if her healthcare costs do not exceed the deductible. We label a person a failure if she does exceed her deductible in the year. Because 70% of the individuals will not hit their deductible, we denote the probability of a success as . The probability of a failure is sometimes denoted with , which would be 0.3 for the insurance example.  When an individual trial only has two possible outcomes, often labeled as success or failure , it is called a Bernoulli random variable . We chose to label a person who does not hit her deductible as a success and all others as failures . However, we could just as easily have reversed these labels. The mathematical framework we will build does not depend on which outcome is labeled a success and which a failure, as long as we are consistent.  Bernoulli random variables are often denoted as 1 for a success and 0 for a failure. In addition to being convenient in entering data, it is also mathematically handy. Suppose we observe ten trials:  1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0  Then the sample proportion , , is the sample mean of these observations: This mathematical inquiry of Bernoulli random variables can be extended even further. Because 0 and 1 are numerical outcomes, we can define the mean and standard deviation of a Bernoulli random variable. (See Exercises and .)    Bernoulli random variable   If is a random variable that takes value 1 with probability of success and 0 with probability , then is a Bernoulli random variable with mean and standard deviation    In general, it is useful to think about a Bernoulli random variable as a random process with only two outcomes: a success or failure. Then we build our mathematical framework using the numerical labels 1 and 0 for successes and failures, respectively.    Geometric distribution  The geometric distribution is used to describe how many trials it takes to observe a success. Let's first look at an example.   Finding first success in insurance claims   Suppose we are working at the insurance company and need to find a case where the person did not exceed her (or his) deductible as a case study. If the probability a person will not exceed her deductible is 0.7 and we are drawing people at random, what are the chances that the first person will not have exceeded her deductible, i.e. be a success? The second person? The third? What about we pull cases before we find the first success, i.e. the first success is the person? (If the first success is the fifth person, then we say .)    The probability of stopping after the first person is just the chance the first person will not hit her (or his) deductible: 0.7. The probability the second person is the first to not hit her deductible is Likewise, the probability it will be the third case is .  If the first success is on the person, then there are failures and finally 1 success, which corresponds to the probability . This is the same as .     illustrates what the geometric distribution is, which describes the waiting time until a success for independent and identically distributed (iid) Bernoulli random variables. In this case, the independence aspect just means the individuals in the example don't affect each other, and identical means they each have the same probability of success.  The geometric distribution from is shown in . In general, the probabilities for a geometric distribution decrease exponentially fast.   The geometric distribution when the probability of success is     While this text will not derive the formulas for the mean (expected) number of trials needed to find the first success or the standard deviation or variance of this distribution, we present general formulas for each.    Geometric Distribution   If the probability of a success in one trial is and the probability of a failure is , then the probability of finding the first success in the trial is given by The mean (i.e. expected value), variance, and standard deviation of this wait time are given by    It is no accident that we use the symbol for both the mean and expected value. The mean and the expected value are one and the same.  It takes, on average, trials to get a success under the geometric distribution. This mathematical result is consistent with what we would expect intuitively. If the probability of a success is high (e.g. 0.8), then we don't usually wait very long for a success: trials on average. If the probability of a success is low (e.g. 0.1), then we would expect to view many trials before we see a success: trials.    The probability that a particular case would not exceed their deductible is said to be 0.7. If we were to examine cases until we found one where the person did not hit her deductible, how many cases should we expect to check?    We would expect to see about individuals to find the first success.     Finding probability of success within first 3 cases   What is the chance that we would find the first success within the first 3 cases?    This is the chance it is the first ( ), second ( ), or third ( ) case is the first success, which are three disjoint outcomes. Because the individuals in the sample are randomly sampled from a large population, they are independent. We compute the probability of each case and add the separate results: There is a probability of 0.973 that we would find a successful case within 3 cases.      Determine a more clever way to solve . Show that you get the same result.    First find the probability of the complement: . Next, compute one minus this probability: .     Expected draws for car insurance   Suppose a car insurer has determined that 88% of its drivers will not exceed their deductible in a given year. If someone at the company were to randomly draw driver files until they found one that had not exceeded their deductible, what is the expected number of drivers the insurance employee must check? What is the standard deviation of the number of driver files that must be drawn?    In this example, a success is again when someone will not exceed the insurance deductible, which has probability . The expected number of people to be checked is and the standard deviation is .      Using the results from , and , would it be appropriate to use the normal model to find what proportion of experiments would end in 3 or fewer trials?    No. The geometric distribution is always right skewed and can never be well-approximated by the normal model.    The independence assumption is crucial to the geometric distribution's accurate description of a scenario. Mathematically, we can see that to construct the probability of the success on the trial, we had to use the Multiplication Rule for Independent Processes. It is no simple task to generalize the geometric model for dependent trials.    Exercises   Is it Bernoulli   Determine if each trial can be considered an independent Bernoulli trial for the following situations.    Cards dealt in a hand of poker.  Outcome of each roll of a die.       With and without replacement   In the following situations assume that half of the specified population is male and the other half is female.     Suppose you're sampling from a room with 10 people. What is the probability of sampling two females in a row when sampling with replacement? What is the probability when sampling without replacement?    Now suppose you're sampling from a stadium with 10,000 people. What is the probability of sampling two females in a row when sampling with replacement? What is the probability when sampling without replacement?    We often treat individuals who are sampled from a large population as independent. Using your findings from parts (a) and (b), explain whether or not this assumption is reasonable.        Eye color, Part I   A husband and wife both have brown eyes but carry genes that make it possible for their children to have brown eyes (probability 0.75), blue eyes (0.125), or green eyes (0.125).     What is the probability the first blue-eyed child they have is their third child? Assume that the eye colors of the children are independent of each other.    On average, how many children would such a pair of parents have before having a blue-eyed child? What is the standard deviation of the number of children they would expect to have until the first blue-eyed child?        Defective rate   A machine that produces a special type of transistor (a component of computers) has a 2% defective rate. The production is considered a random process where each transistor is independent of the others.     What is the probability that the transistor produced is the first with a defect?    What is the probability that the machine produces no defective transistors in a batch of 100?    On average, how many transistors would you expect to be produced before the first with a defect? What is the standard deviation?    Another machine that also produces transistors has a 5% defective rate where each transistor is produced independent of the others. On average how many transistors would you expect to be produced with this machine before the first with a defect? What is the standard deviation?    Based on your answers to parts (c) and (d), how does increasing the probability of an event affect the mean and standard deviation of the wait time until success?

That is, compute the square root of the variance of a generic Bernoulli random variable.     "

  "body": " Binomial distribution   The binomial distribution is used to describe the number of successes in a fixed number of trials. This is different from the geometric distribution, which described the number of trials we must wait before we observe a success.    The binomial distribution  Let's again imagine ourselves back at the insurance agency where 70% of individuals do not exceed their deductible.   Probability of one exceeding deductible   Suppose the insurance agency is considering a random sample of four individuals they insure. What is the chance exactly one of them will exceed the deductible and the other three will not? Let's call the four people Ariana ( ), Brittany ( ), Carlton ( ), and Damian ( ) for convenience.    Let's consider a scenario where one person exceeds the deductible: But there are three other scenarios: Brittany, Carlton, or Damian could have been the one to exceed the deductible. In each of these cases, the probability is again . These four scenarios exhaust all the possible ways that exactly one of these four people could have exceeded the deductible, so the total probability is       Verify that the scenario where Brittany is the only one to exceed the deductible has probability .     .    The scenario outlined in is an example of a binomial distribution scenario. The binomial distribution describes the probability of having exactly successes in independent Bernoulli trials with probability of a success (in , , , ). We would like to determine the probabilities associated with the binomial distribution more generally, i.e. we want a formula where we can use , , and to obtain the probability. To do this, we reexamine each part of .  There were four individuals who could have been the one to exceed the deductible, and each of these four scenarios had the same probability. Thus, we could identify the final probability as The first component of this equation is the number of ways to arrange the successes among the trials. The second component is the probability of any of the four (equally probable) scenarios.  Consider under the general case of successes and failures in the trials. In any such scenario, we apply the Multiplication Rule for independent events: This is our general formula for .  Secondly, we introduce a general formula for the number of ways to choose successes in trials, i.e. arrange successes and failures: The quantity is read n choose k . Other notation for choose includes , , and . The exclamation point notation (e.g. ) denotes a factorial expression. Using the formula, we can compute the number of ways to choose successes in trials: This result is exactly what we found by carefully thinking of each possible scenario in .  Substituting choose for the number of scenarios and for the single scenario probability yields the general binomial formula.    Binomial distribution   Suppose the probability of a single trial being a success is . Then the probability of observing exactly successes in independent trials is given by The mean, variance, and standard deviation of the number of observed successes are      Is it binomial? Four conditions to check.     The trials are independent.  The number of trials, , is fixed.  Each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure .  The probability of a success, , is the same for each trial.      Probability of 3 of 8 exceeding deductible   What is the probability that 3 of 8 randomly selected individuals will have exceeded the insurance deductible, i.e. that 5 of 8 will not exceed the deductible? Recall that 70% of individuals will not exceed the deductible.    We would like to apply the binomial model, so we check the conditions. The number of trials is fixed ( ) (condition 2) and each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure (condition 3). Because the sample is random, the trials are independent (condition 1) and the probability of a success is the same for each trial (condition 4).  In the outcome of interest, there are successes in trials (recall that a success is an individual who does not exceed the deductible), and the probability of a success is . So the probability that 5 of 8 will not exceed the deductible and 3 will exceed the deductible is given by Dealing with the factorial part: Using , the final probability is about .      Computing binomial probabilities   The first step in using the binomial model is to check that the model is appropriate. The second step is to identify , , and . As the last stage use software or the formulas to determine the probability, then interpret the results.  If you must do calculations by hand, it's often useful to cancel out as many terms as possible in the top and bottom of the binomial coefficient.     If we randomly sampled 40 case files from the insurance agency discussed earlier, how many of the cases would you expect to not have exceeded the deductible in a given year? What is the standard deviation of the number that would not have exceeded the deductible?    We are asked to determine the expected number (the mean) and the standard deviation, both of which can be directly computed from the formulas: and . Because very roughly 95% of observations fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean (see Section 1.6.3), we would probably observe at least 22 but fewer than 34 individuals in our sample who would not exceed the deductible.      The probability that a random smoker will develop a severe lung condition in his or her lifetime is about 0.3. If you have 4 friends who smoke, are the conditions for the binomial model satisfied?    One possible answer: if the friends know each other, then the independence assumption is probably not satisfied. For example, acquaintances may have similar smoking habits, or those friends might make a pact to quit together.      Suppose these four friends do not know each other and we can treat them as if they were a random sample from the population. Is the binomial model appropriate? What is the probability that  None of them will develop a severe lung condition?  One will develop a severe lung condition?  That no more than one will develop a severe lung condition?      To check if the binomial model is appropriate, we must verify the conditions. (i) Since we are supposing we can treat the friends as a random sample, they are independent. (ii) We have a fixed number of trials ( ). (iii) Each outcome is a success or failure. (iv) The probability of a success is the same for each trial since the individuals are like a random sample ( if we say a success is someone getting a lung condition, a morbid choice).  Compute parts (a) and (b) using the binomial formula: , . Note: . Part (c) can be computed as the sum of parts (a) and (b): . That is, there is about a 65% chance that no more than one of your four smoking friends will develop a severe lung condition.      What is the probability that at least 2 of your 4 smoking friends will develop a severe lung condition in their lifetimes?    The complement (no more than one will develop a severe lung condition) as computed in as 0.6517, so we compute one minus this value: 0.3483.      Suppose you have 7 friends who are smokers and they can be treated as a random sample of smokers.   How many would you expect to develop a severe lung condition, i.e. what is the mean?    What is the probability that at most 2 of your 7 friends will develop a severe lung condition?       (a) . (b) .    Next we consider the first term in the binomial probability, choose under some special scenarios.    Why is it true that and for any number ?    Frame these expressions into words. How many different ways are there to arrange 0 successes and failures in trials? (1 way.) How many different ways are there to arrange successes and 0 failures in trials? (1 way.)      How many ways can you arrange one success and failures in trials? How many ways can you arrange successes and one failure in trials?    One success and failures: there are exactly unique places we can put the success, so there are ways to arrange one success and failures. A similar argument is used for the second question. Mathematically, we show these results by verifying the following two equations:       Normal approximation to the binomial distribution  The binomial formula is cumbersome when the sample size ( ) is large, particularly when we consider a range of observations. In some cases we may use the normal distribution as an easier and faster way to estimate binomial probabilities.   Smoker survey probability   Approximately 15% of the US population smokes cigarettes. A local government believed their community had a lower smoker rate and commissioned a survey of 400 randomly selected individuals. The survey found that only 42 of the 400 participants smoke cigarettes. If the true proportion of smokers in the community was really 15%, what is the probability of observing 42 or fewer smokers in a sample of 400 people?    We leave the usual verification that the four conditions for the binomial model are valid as an exercise.  The question posed is equivalent to asking, what is the probability of observing , 1, 2, , or 42 smokers in a sample of when ? We can compute these 43 different probabilities and add them together to find the answer: If the true proportion of smokers in the community is , then the probability of observing 42 or fewer smokers in a sample of is 0.0054.    The computations in are tedious and long. In general, we should avoid such work if an alternative method exists that is faster, easier, and still accurate. Recall that calculating probabilities of a range of values is much easier in the normal model. We might wonder, is it reasonable to use the normal model in place of the binomial distribution? Surprisingly, yes, if certain conditions are met.    Here we consider the binomial model when the probability of a success is . shows four hollow histograms for simulated samples from the binomial distribution using four different sample sizes: . What happens to the shape of the distributions as the sample size increases? What distribution does the last hollow histogram resemble?    The distribution is transformed from a blocky and skewed distribution into one that rather resembles the normal distribution in last hollow histogram.     Hollow histograms of samples from the binomial model when . The sample sizes for the four plots are , 30, 100, and 300, respectively.      Normal approximation of the binomial distribution   The binomial distribution with probability of success is nearly normal when the sample size is sufficiently large that and are both at least 10. The approximate normal distribution has parameters corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of the binomial distribution:    The normal approximation may be used when computing the range of many possible successes. For instance, we may apply the normal distribution to the setting of .   Normal approximation for smoker survey   How can we use the normal approximation to estimate the probability of observing 42 or fewer smokers in a sample of 400, if the true proportion of smokers is ?    Showing that the binomial model is reasonable was a suggested exercise in . We also verify that both and are at least 10: With these conditions checked, we may use the normal approximation in place of the binomial distribution using the mean and standard deviation from the binomial model: We want to find the probability of observing 42 or fewer smokers using this model.      Use the normal model to estimate the probability of observing 42 or fewer smokers. Your answer should be approximately equal to the solution of : 0.0054.    Compute the Z-score first: . The corresponding left tail area is 0.0059.      The normal approximation breaks down on small intervals  The normal approximation to the binomial distribution tends to perform poorly when estimating the probability of a small range of counts, even when the conditions are met.  Suppose we wanted to compute the probability of observing 49, 50, or 51 smokers in 400 when . With such a large sample, we might be tempted to apply the normal approximation and use the range 49 to 51. However, we would find that the binomial solution and the normal approximation notably differ: We can identify the cause of this discrepancy using , which shows the areas representing the binomial probability (outlined) and normal approximation (shaded). Notice that the width of the area under the normal distribution is 0.5 units too slim on both sides of the interval.   A normal curve with the area between 49 and 51 shaded. The outlined area represents the exact binomial probability.      Improving the normal approximation for the binomial distribution   The normal approximation to the binomial distribution for intervals of values is usually improved if cutoff values are modified slightly. The cutoff values for the lower end of a shaded region should be reduced by 0.5, and the cutoff value for the upper end should be increased by 0.5.   The tip to add extra area when applying the normal approximation is most often useful when examining a range of observations. In the example above, the revised normal distribution estimate is 0.0633, much closer to the exact value of 0.0649. While it is possible to also apply this correction when computing a tail area, the benefit of the modification usually disappears since the total interval is typically quite wide.

Sickle cell anemia   Sickle cell anemia is a genetic blood disorder where red blood cells lose their flexibility and assume an abnormal, rigid, sickle shape, which results in a risk of various complications. If both parents are carriers of the disease, then a child has a 25% chance of having the disease, 50% chance of being a carrier, and 25% chance of neither having the disease nor being a carrier. If two parents who are carriers of the disease have 3 children, what is the probability that    two will have the disease?  none will have the disease?  at least one will neither have the disease nor be a carrier?  the first child with the disease will the be 3rd child?       Exploring permutations   The formula for the number of ways to arrange objects is . This exercise walks you through the derivation of this formula for a couple of special cases.  A small company has five employees: Anna, Ben, Carl, Damian, and Eddy. There are five parking spots in a row at the company, none of which are assigned, and each day the employees pull into a random parking spot. That is, all possible orderings of the cars in the row of spots are equally likely.     On a given day, what is the probability that the employees park in alphabetical order?    If the alphabetical order has an equal chance of occurring relative to all other possible orderings, how many ways must there be to arrange the five cars?    Now consider a sample of 8 employees instead. How many possible ways are there to order these 8 employees' cars?        Male children   While it is often assumed that the probabilities of having a boy or a girl are the same, the actual probability of having a boy is slightly higher at 0.51. Suppose a couple plans to have 3 kids.     Use the binomial model to calculate the probability that two of them will be boys.    Write out all possible orderings of 3 children, 2 of whom are boys. Use these scenarios to calculate the same probability from part (a) but using the addition rule for disjoint outcomes. Confirm that your answers from parts (a) and (b) match.    If we wanted to calculate the probability that a couple who plans to have 8 kids will have 3 boys, briefly describe why the approach from part (b) would be more tedious than the approach from part (a).

So the probability that 5 of 8 will not exceed the deductible and 3 will exceed the deductible is given by Dealing with the factorial part: Using , the final probability is about .   "

  "body": " Negative binomial distribution   The geometric distribution describes the probability of observing the first success on the trial. The negative binomial distribution is more general: it describes the probability of observing the success on the trial.    Field goal attempts   Each day a high school football coach tells his star kicker, Brian, that he can go home after he successfully kicks four 35 yard field goals. Suppose we say each kick has a probability of being successful. If is small e.g. close to 0.1 would we expect Brian to need many attempts before he successfully kicks his fourth field goal?    We are waiting for the fourth success ( ). If the probability of a success ( ) is small, then the number of attempts ( ) will probably be large. This means that Brian is more likely to need many attempts before he gets successes. To put this another way, the probability of being small is low.    To identify a negative binomial case, we check 4 conditions. The first three are common to the binomial distribution.    Is it negative binomial? Four conditions to check     The trials are independent.  Each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure.  The probability of a success ( ) is the same for each trial.  The last trial must be a success.       Suppose Brian is very diligent in his attempts and he makes each 35 yard field goal with probability . Take a guess at how many attempts he would need before making his fourth kick.    One possible answer: since he is likely to make each field goal attempt, it will take him at least 4 attempts but probably not more than 6 or 7.     Sequences of successes and failures   In yesterday's practice, it took Brian only 6 tries to get his fourth field goal. Write out each of the possible sequences of kicks.    Because it took Brian six tries to get the fourth success, we know the last kick must have been a success. That leaves three successful kicks and two unsuccessful kicks (we label these as failures) that make up the first five attempts. There are ten possible sequences of these first five kicks, which are shown in . If Brian achieved his fourth success ( ) on his sixth attempt ( ), then his order of successes and failures must be one of these ten possible sequences.     The ten possible sequences when the fourth successful kick is on the sixth attempt. S denotes a success and F denotes a failure.     Kick Attempt     1  2  3  4  5  6    1          2          3          4          5          6          7          8          9          10             Each sequence in has exactly two failures and four successes with the last attempt always being a success. If the probability of a success is , find the probability of the first sequence.    The first sequence: .    If the probability Brian kicks a 35 yard field goal is , what is the probability it takes Brian exactly six tries to get his fourth successful kick? We can write this as where the sequences are from . We can break down this last probability into the sum of ten disjoint possibilities: The probability of the first sequence was identified in as 0.0164, and each of the other sequences have the same probability. Since each of the ten sequences has the same probability, the total probability is ten times that of any individual sequence.  The way to compute this negative binomial probability is similar to how the binomial problems were solved in . The probability is broken into two pieces: Each part is examined separately, then we multiply to get the final result.  We first identify the probability of a single sequence. One particular case is to first observe all the failures ( of them) followed by the successes:   We must also identify the number of sequences for the general case. Above, ten sequences were identified where the fourth success came on the sixth attempt. These sequences were identified by fixing the last observation as a success and looking for all the ways to arrange the other observations. In other words, how many ways could we arrange successes in trials? This can be found using the choose coefficient but for and instead: This is the number of different ways we can order successes and failures in trials.    Negative binomial distribution   The negative binomial distribution describes the probability of observing the success on the trial, where all trials are independent: The value represents the probability that an individual trial is a success.    Using the negative binomial formula   Show using the formula for the negative binomial distribution that the probability Brian kicks his fourth successful field goal on the sixth attempt is 0.164.    The probability of a single success is , the number of successes is , and the number of necessary attempts under this scenario is .       The negative binomial distribution requires that each kick attempt by Brian is independent. Do you think it is reasonable to suggest that each of Brian's kick attempts are independent?    Answers may vary. We cannot conclusively say they are or are not independent. However, many statistical reviews of athletic performance suggest such attempts are very nearly independent.      Assume Brian's kick attempts are independent. What is the probability that Brian will kick his fourth field goal within 5 attempts?    If his fourth field goal ( ) is within five attempts, it either took him four or five tries ( or ). We have from earlier. Use the negative binomial distribution to compute the probability of tries and tries, then add those probabilities together:       Binomial versus negative binomial   In the binomial case, we typically have a fixed number of trials and instead consider the number of successes. In the negative binomial case, we examine how many trials it takes to observe a fixed number of successes and require that the last observation be a success.     On 70% of days, a hospital admits at least one heart attack patient. On 30% of the days, no heart attack patients are admitted. Identify each case below as a binomial or negative binomial case, and compute the probability.     What is the probability the hospital will admit a heart attack patient on exactly three days this week?    What is the probability the second day with a heart attack patient will be the fourth day of the week?    What is the probability the fifth day of next month will be the first day with a heart attack patient?       In each part, .     The number of days is fixed, so this is binomial. The parameters are and : 0.097.    The last success (admitting a heart attack patient) is fixed to the last day, so we should apply the negative binomial distribution. The parameters are , : 0.132.    This problem is negative binomial with and : 0.006. Note that the negative binomial case when is the same as using the geometric distribution.

What is the probability that her serve will be successful?    Even though parts (a) and (b) discuss the same scenario, the probabilities you calculated should be different. Can you explain the reason for this discrepancy?        "

  "body": " Poisson distribution   AMI incidents in New York City   There are about 8 million individuals in New York City. How many individuals might we expect to be hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), i.e. a heart attack, each day? According to historical records, the average number is about 4.4 individuals. However, we would also like to know the approximate distribution of counts. What would a histogram of the number of AMI occurrences each day look like if we recorded the daily counts over an entire year?    A histogram of the number of occurrences of AMI on 365 days for NYC is shown in . These data are simulated. In practice, we should check for an association between successive days. The sample mean (4.38) is similar to the historical average of 4.4. The sample standard deviation is about 2, and the histogram indicates that about 70% of the data fall between 2.4 and 6.4. The distribution's shape is unimodal and skewed to the right.     A histogram of the number of occurrences of AMI on 365 separate days in NYC.    The Poisson distribution is often useful for estimating the number of events in a large population over a unit of time. For instance, consider each of the following events:  having a heart attack,  getting married, and  getting struck by lightning.  The Poisson distribution helps us describe the number of such events that will occur in a day for a fixed population if the individuals within the population are independent. The Poisson distribution could also be used over another unit of time, such as an hour or a week.  The histogram in approximates a Poisson distribution with rate equal to 4.4. The rate for a Poisson distribution is the average number of occurrences in a mostly-fixed population per unit of time. In , the time unit is a day, the population is all New York City residents, and the historical rate is 4.4. The parameter in the Poisson distribution is the rate or how many events we expect to observe and it is typically denoted by (the Greek letter lambda ) or . Using the rate, we can describe the probability of observing exactly events in a single unit of time.    Poisson distribution   Suppose we are watching for events and the number of observed events follows a Poisson distribution with rate . Then where may take a value 0, 1, 2, and so on, and represents -factorial, as described on page . The letter is the base of the natural logarithm. The mean and standard deviation of this distribution are and , respectively.   We will leave a rigorous set of conditions for the Poisson distribution to a later course. However, we offer a few simple guidelines that can be used for an initial evaluation of whether the Poisson model would be appropriate.  A random variable may follow a Poisson distribution if we are looking for the number of events, the population that generates such events is large, and the events occur independently of each other.  Even when events are not really independent for instance, Saturdays and Sundays are especially popular for weddings a Poisson model may sometimes still be reasonable if we allow it to have a different rate for different times. In the wedding example, the rate would be modeled as higher on weekends than on weekdays. The idea of modeling rates for a Poisson distribution against a second variable such as the day of week forms the foundation of some more advanced methods that fall in the realm of generalized linear models . In Chapters and , we will discuss a foundation of linear models.

Ebay allows you to set your maximum bid price so that if someone outbids you on an auction you can automatically outbid them, up to the maximum bid price you set. If you are only bidding on one auction, what are the advantages and disadvantages of setting a bid price too high or too low? What if you are bidding on multiple auctions?    If you watched 10 auctions, roughly what percentile might you use for a maximum bid cutoff to be somewhat sure that you will win one of these ten auctions? Is it possible to find a cutoff point that will ensure that you win an auction?

If there are 2,000 10 year olds entering Six Flags Magic Mountain in a single day, then compute the expected number of 10 year olds who are at least 76 inches tall.

  "title": "Point Estimates and Sampling Variability",
  "body": " Point Estimates and Sampling Variability   Companies such as Pew Research frequently conduct polls as a way to understand the state of public opinion or knowledge on many topics, including politics, scientific understanding, brand recognition, and more. The ultimate goal in taking a poll is generally to use the responses to estimate the opinion or knowledge of the broader population.    Point Estimates and Error  Suppose a poll suggested the US President's approval rating is 45%. We would consider 45% to be a point estimate of the approval rating we might see if we collected responses from the entire population. This entire-population response proportion is generally referred to as the parameter of interest .  When the parameter is a proportion, it is often denoted by , and we often refer to the sample proportion as (pronounced p-hat Not to be confused with phat , the slang term used for something cool, like this book. ). Unless we collect responses from every individual in the population, remains unknown, and we use as our estimate of . The difference we observe from the poll versus the parameter is called the error in the estimate.  Generally, the error consists of two aspects: sampling error and bias.   Sampling error , sometimes called sampling uncertainty , describes how much an estimate will tend to vary from one sample to the next. For instance, the estimate from one sample might be 1% too low while in another it may be 3% too high. Much of statistics, including much of this book, is focused on understanding and quantifying sampling error, and we will find it useful to consider a sample's size to help us quantify this error; the sample size is often represented by the letter .   Bias describes a systematic tendency to over- or under-estimate the true population value. For example, if we were taking a student poll asking about support for a new college stadium, we'd probably get a biased estimate of the stadium's level of student support by wording the question as, Do you support your school by supporting funding for the new stadium? We try to minimize bias through thoughtful data collection procedures, which were discussed in Chapter 1 and are the topic of many other books.    Understanding the Variability of a Point Estimate  Suppose the proportion of American adults who support the expansion of solar energy is , which is our parameter of interest. We haven't actually conducted a census to measure this value perfectly. However, a very large sample has suggested the actual level of support is about 88%. If we were to take a poll of 1000 American adults on this topic, the estimate would not be perfect, but how close might we expect the sample proportion in the poll would be to 88%? We want to understand, how does the sample proportion behave when the true population proportion is 0.88 . 88% written as a proportion would be 0.88. It is common to switch between proportion and percent. However, formulas presented in this book always refer to the proportion, not the percent. Let's find out!  We can simulate responses we would get from a simple random sample of 1000 American adults, which is only possible because we know the actual support for expanding solar energy is 0.88. Here's how we might go about constructing such a simulation:   There were about 250 million American adults in 2018. On 250 million pieces of paper, write support on 88% of them and not on the other 12%.  Mix up the pieces of paper and pull out 1000 pieces to represent our sample of 1000 American adults.  Compute the fraction of the sample that say support .   Any volunteers to conduct this simulation? Probably not. Running this simulation with 250 million pieces of paper would be time-consuming and very costly, but we can simulate it using computer code; we've written a short program in in case you are curious what the computer code looks like. In this simulation, the sample gave a point estimate of . We know the population proportion for the simulation was , so we know the estimate had an error of .   For those curious, this is code for a single simulation using the statistical software called R. Each line that starts with # is a code comment , which is used to describe in regular language what the code is doing. We've provided software labs in R at openintro.org\/book\/os for anyone interested in learning more.   # 1. Create a set of 250 million entries, # where 88% of them are \"support\" and 12% are \"not\". pop_size <- 250000000 possible_entries <- c(rep(\"support\", 0.88 * pop_size), rep(\"not\", 0.12 * pop_size)) # 2. Sample 1000 entries without replacement. sampled_entries <- sample(possible_entries, size = 1000) # 3. Compute p-hat: count the number that are \"support\", # then divide by the sample size. sum(sampled_entries == \"support\") \/ 1000    One simulation isn't enough to get a great sense of the distribution of estimates we might expect in the simulation, so we should run more simulations. In a second simulation, we get , which has an error of +0.005. In another, for an error of -0.002. And in another, an estimate of with an error of -0.021. With the help of a computer, we've run the simulation 10,000 times and created a histogram of the results from all 10,000 simulations in . This distribution of sample proportions is called a sampling distribution . We can characterize this sampling distribution as follows:   Center. The center of the distribution is , which is the same as the parameter. Notice that the simulation mimicked a simple random sample of the population, which is a straightforward sampling strategy that helps avoid sampling bias.  Spread. The standard deviation of the distribution is . When we're talking about a sampling distribution or the variability of a point estimate, we typically use the term standard error rather than standard deviation , and the notation is used for the standard error associated with the sample proportion.  Shape. The distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, and it resembles a normal distribution .   These findings are encouraging! When the population proportion is and the sample size is , the sample proportion tends to give a pretty good estimate of the population proportion. We also have the interesting observation that the histogram resembles a normal distribution.   A histogram of 10,000 sample proportions, where each sample is taken from a population where the population proportion is 0.88 and the sample size is .   A histogram is shown for 10,000 sample proportions where each sample is taken from a population where the population proportion is 0.88 and the sample size is n = 1000. The distribution is bell-shaped (appears nearly normal), is centered at 0.88 and has a standard deviation of about 0.01.     Sampling distributions are never observed, but we keep them in mind  In real-world applications, we never actually observe the sampling distribution, yet it is useful to always think of a point estimate as coming from such a hypothetical distribution. Understanding the sampling distribution will help us characterize and make sense of the point estimates that we do observe.     If we used a much smaller sample size of , would you guess that the standard error for would be larger or smaller than when we used ?    Intuitively, it seems like more data is better than less data, and generally that is correct! The typical error when and would be larger than the error we would expect when .    Example highlights an important property we will see again and again: a bigger sample tends to provide a more precise point estimate than a smaller sample.    Central Limit Theorem  The distribution in looks an awful lot like a normal distribution. That is no anomaly; it is the result of a general principle called the Central Limit Theorem .   Central Limit Theorem and the success-failure condition  When observations are independent and the sample size is sufficiently large, the sample proportion will tend to follow a normal distribution with the following mean and standard error:   In order for the Central Limit Theorem to hold, the sample size is typically considered sufficiently large when and , which is called the success-failure condition .   The Central Limit Theorem is incredibly important, and it provides a foundation for much of statistics. As we begin applying the Central Limit Theorem, be mindful of the two technical conditions: the observations must be independent, and the sample size must be sufficiently large such that and .    Earlier we estimated the mean and standard error of using simulated data when and . Confirm that the Central Limit Theorem applies and the sampling distribution is approximately normal.       Independence. There are observations for each sample proportion , and each of those observations are independent draws. The most common way for observations to be considered independent is if they are from a simple random sample.      Success-failure condition. We can confirm the sample size is sufficiently large by checking the success-failure condition and confirming the two calculated values are greater than 10:     The independence and success-failure conditions are both satisfied, so the Central Limit Theorem applies, and it's reasonable to model using a normal distribution.     How to verify sample observations are independent  Subjects in an experiment are considered independent if they undergo random assignment to the treatment groups.  If the observations are from a simple random sample, then they are independent.  If a sample is from a seemingly random process, e.g. an occasional error on an assembly line, checking independence is more difficult. In this case, use your best judgement.   An additional condition that is sometimes added for samples from a population is that they are no larger than 10% of the population. When the sample exceeds 10% of the population size, the methods we discuss tend to overestimate the sampling error slightly versus what we would get using more advanced methods. For example, we could use what's called the finite population correction factor : if the sample is of size and the population size is , then we can multiply the typical standard error formula by to obtain a smaller, more precise estimate of the actual standard error. When , this correction factor is relatively small. This is very rarely an issue, and when it is an issue, our methods tend to be conservative, so we consider this additional check as optional.    Compute the theoretical mean and standard error of when and , according to the Central Limit Theorem.    The mean of the 's is simply the population proportion:   The calculation of the standard error of uses the following formula:       Estimate how frequently the sample proportion should be within 0.02 (2%) of the population value, . Based on Examples and , we know that the distribution is approximately .    After so much practice in Section 4.1, this normal distribution example will hopefully feel familiar! We would like to understand the fraction of 's between 0.86 and 0.90:   A normal distribution centered at 0.88 with a standard deviation of 0.01 is shown, where the region between 0.86 and 0.90 has been shaded.   Normal curve centered at 0.88 with shaded region between 0.86 and 0.90    With and , we can compute the Z-score for both the left and right cutoffs:   We can use either statistical software, a graphing calculator, or a table to find the areas to the tails, and in any case we will find that they are each 0.0228. The total tail areas are , which leaves the shaded area of 0.9544. That is, about 95.44% of the sampling distribution in is within of the population proportion, .      In Example we discussed how a smaller sample would tend to produce a less reliable estimate. Explain how this intuition is reflected in the formula for . Since the sample size is in the denominator (on the bottom) of the fraction, a bigger sample size means the entire expression when calculated will tend to be smaller. That is, a larger sample size would correspond to a smaller standard error.       Applying the Central Limit Theorem to a real-world setting  We do not actually know the population proportion unless we conduct an expensive poll of all individuals in the population. Our earlier value of was based on poll conducted by Pew Research of 1000 American adults that found of them favored expanding solar energy. The researchers might have wondered: does the sample proportion from the poll approximately follow a normal distribution? We can check the conditions from the Central Limit Theorem:     Independence. The poll is a simple random sample of American adults, which means that the observations are independent.     Success-failure condition. To check this condition, we need the population proportion, , to check if both and are greater than 10. However, we do not actually know , which is exactly why the pollsters would take a sample! In cases like these, we often use as our next best way to check the success-failure condition: The sample proportion acts as a reasonable substitute for during this check, and each value in this case is well above the minimum of 10.    This substitution approximation of using in place of is also useful when computing the standard error of the sample proportion: This substitution technique is sometimes referred to as the plug-in principle . In this case, didn't change enough to be detected using only 3 decimal places versus when we completed the calculation with 0.88 earlier. The computed standard error tends to be reasonably stable even when observing slightly different proportions in one sample or another.    More details regarding the Central Limit Theorem  We've applied the Central Limit Theorem in numerous examples so far this chapter:    When observations are independent and the sample size is sufficiently large, the distribution of resembles a normal distribution with   The sample size is considered sufficiently large when and .    In this section, we'll explore the success-failure condition and seek to better understand the Central Limit Theorem.  An interesting question to answer is, what happens when or ? As we did in Section , we can simulate drawing samples of different sizes where, say, the true proportion is . Here's a sample of size 10:   no, no, yes, yes, no, no, no, no, no, no   In this sample, we observe a sample proportion of yeses of . We can simulate many such proportions to understand the sampling distribution of when and , which we've plotted in alongside a normal distribution with the same mean and variability. These distributions have a number of important differences.   Left: simulations of when the sample size is and the population proportion is . Right: a normal distribution with the same mean (0.25) and standard deviation (0.137).   There are two plots. The first plot is a histogram of 10,000 simulations of p-hat when the sample size is n equals 10 and the population proportion is p equals 0.25. The possible values are 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and so on up to 1.0, though the graph only shows values up to 0.8. The distribution is centered at about 0.25, and is slightly right-skewed. The frequencies are about 500 for 0.0, 1900 for 0.1, 2800 for 0.2, 2400 for 0.3, 1500 for 0.4, 500 for 0.5, 100 for 0.6, and the bin heights for the remaining values have bin heights that are not visually distinguishable from zero. The second plot shows a normal distribution centered at 0.25 with a standard deviation of 0.137. The plot has a vertical line located at 0.0, which makes it more visually evident that a portion of the area under the normal distribution -- about 5% of this area -- represents values below 0.0.     and show sampling distributions for several scenarios of and .   Sampling distributions for several scenarios of and . Rows: , , , , and . Columns: and .   Sampling distributions are shown for several scenarios for parameters p and n. The graphs are arranged in a grid of 5 rows representing proportions 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.9 and 2 columns of sample sizes n equals 10 and 25. In each graph, the distribution is centered at the proportion. Given that these are proportions based on relatively small sample sizes, the bins do look relatively discrete (jumpy from one to the next), though less so for the distributions based on n equals 25. In cases where the true underlying proportion is near the lower bound of 0 or the upper bound of 1, the distribution tends to skew away from that boundary. This is most noticeable for both the distributions representing proportions closer to either boundary and for the smaller sample size. One distribution stands out among the 10 shown: the sample with p equals 0.5 and n equals 25, which shows a bell-shaped distribution resembling the normal distribution, though the data are still somewhat discrete.     Sampling distributions for several scenarios of and . Rows: , , , , and . Columns: , , and .   Sampling distributions are shown for several scenarios for parameters p and n. The graphs are arranged in a grid of 5 rows representing proportions 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.9 and 3 columns of sample sizes n equals 50, 100, and 250. Relative to the previous figure, which considered similar proportion scenarios but with n equals 10 and 25, the data in these graphs looks less discrete -- that is, they appear to almost be continuous. This is most evident for the largest sample sizes. Nearly all of the graphs shown also closely resemble the normal distribution, in some cases with the larger sample sizes that it resembles it so closely that there are not substantial visual differences. One aspect less evident -- but still present -- in the last figure but that continues into and becomes much more obvious in this figure, is that the distributions of the sample proportions tend to have a much smaller standard deviation with the larger sample sizes. That is, the sample proportion distributions for larger sample sizes tend to be smaller than they were for smaller sample sizes. Also, the variability within a graph also appears to be largest for the proportion p equals 0.5 than it is for the other proportions when considering a single proportion -- and this property is apparent upon inspection of a distribution based on any of the considered sample sizes.     Comparison of distributions     Unimodal?  Smooth?  Symmetric?    Normal:  Yes  Yes  Yes    ,  Yes  No  No     Notice that the success-failure condition was not satisfied when and : This single sampling distribution does not show that the success-failure condition is the perfect guideline, but we have found that the guideline did correctly identify that a normal distribution might not be appropriate.  We can complete several additional simulations, shown in and , and we can see some trends:   When either or is small, the distribution is more discrete , i.e. not continuous .  When or is smaller than 10, the skew in the distribution is more noteworthy.  The larger both  and  , the more normal the distribution. This may be a little harder to see for the larger sample size in these plots as the variability also becomes much smaller.  When and are both very large, the distribution's discreteness is hardly evident, and the distribution looks much more like a normal distribution.   So far we've only focused on the skew and discreteness of the distributions. We haven't considered how the mean and standard error of the distributions change. Take a moment to look back at the graphs, and pay attention to three things:   The centers of the distribution are always at the population proportion, , that was used to generate the simulation. Because the sampling distribution of is always centered at the population parameter , it means the sample proportion is unbiased when the data are independent and drawn from such a population.  For a particular population proportion , the variability in the sampling distribution decreases as the sample size becomes larger. This will likely align with your intuition: an estimate based on a larger sample size will tend to be more accurate.  For a particular sample size, the variability will be largest when . The differences may be a little subtle, so take a close look. This reflects the role of the proportion in the standard error formula: . The standard error is largest when .   At no point will the distribution of look perfectly normal, since will always take discrete values ( ). It is always a matter of degree, and we will use the standard success-failure condition with minimums of 10 for and as our guideline within this book.    Extending the framework for other statistics  The strategy of using a sample statistic to estimate a parameter is quite common, and it's a strategy that we can apply to other statistics besides a proportion. For instance, if we want to estimate the average salary for graduates from a particular college, we could survey a random sample of recent graduates; in that example, we'd be using a sample mean to estimate the population mean for all graduates. As another example, if we want to estimate the difference in product prices for two websites, we might take a random sample of products available on both sites, check the prices on each, and then compute the average difference; this strategy certainly would give us some idea of the actual difference through a point estimate.  While this chapter emphasizes a single proportion context, we'll encounter many different contexts throughout this book where these methods will be applied. The principles and general ideas are the same, even if the details change a little. We've also sprinkled some other contexts into the exercises to help you start thinking about how the ideas generalize.    Section 5.1 Exercises   Identify the parameter, Part I   For each of the following situations, state whether the parameter of interest is a mean or a proportion. It may be helpful to examine whether individual responses are numerical or categorical.   In a survey, one hundred college students are asked how many hours per week they spend on the Internet.  In a survey, one hundred college students are asked: \"What percentage of the time you spend on the Internet is part of your course work?\"  In a survey, one hundred college students are asked whether or not they cited information from Wikipedia in their papers.  In a survey, one hundred college students are asked what percentage of their total weekly spending is on alcoholic beverages.  In a sample of one hundred recent college graduates, it is found that 85 percent expect to get a job within one year of their graduation date.      Identify the parameter, Part II   For each of the following situations, state whether the parameter of interest is a mean or a proportion.   A poll shows that 64% of Americans personally worry a great deal about federal spending and the budget deficit.  A survey reports that local TV news has shown a 17% increase in revenue within a two year period while newspaper revenues decreased by 6.4% during this time period.  In a survey, high school and college students are asked whether or not they use geolocation services on their smart phones.  In a survey, smart phone users are asked whether or not they use a web-based taxi service.  In a survey, smart phone users are asked how many times they used a web-based taxi service over the last year.      Quality control   As part of a quality control process for computer chips, an engineer at a factory randomly samples 212 chips during a week of production to test the current rate of chips with severe defects. She finds that 27 of the chips are defective.   What population is under consideration in the data set?  What parameter is being estimated?  What is the point estimate for the parameter?  What is the name of the statistic we use to measure the uncertainty of the point estimate?  Compute this value for this context.  The historical rate of defects is 10%. Should the engineer be surprised by the observed rate of defects during the current week?  Suppose the true population value was found to be 10%. If we use this proportion to recompute the value in part (e) using instead of , does the resulting value change much?      Unexpected expense   In a random sample of 765 adults in the United States, 322 say they could not cover a $400 unexpected expense without borrowing money or going into debt.   What population is under consideration in the data set?  What parameter is being estimated?  What is the point estimate for the parameter?  What is the name of the statistic we use to measure the uncertainty of the point estimate?  Compute the value from part (d) for this context.  A cable news pundit thinks the value is actually 50%. Should she be surprised by the data?  Suppose the true population value was found to be 40%. If we use this proportion to recompute the value in part (e) using instead of , does the resulting value change much?      Repeated water samples   A nonprofit wants to understand the fraction of households that have elevated levels of lead in their drinking water. They expect at least 5% of homes will have elevated levels of lead, but not more than about 30%. They randomly sample 800 homes and work with the owners to retrieve water samples, and they compute the fraction of these homes with elevated lead levels. They repeat this 1,000 times and build a distribution of sample proportions.   What is this distribution called?  Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed? Explain your reasoning.  If the proportions are distributed around 8%, what is the variability of the distribution?  What is the formal name of the value you computed in (c)?  Suppose the researchers' budget is reduced, and they are only able to collect 250 observations per sample, but they can still collect 1,000 samples. They build a new distribution of sample proportions. How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 800 observations?      Repeated student samples   Of all freshman at a large college, 16% made the dean's list in the current year. As part of a class project, students randomly sample 40 students and check if those students made the list. They repeat this 1,000 times and build a distribution of sample proportions.   What is this distribution called?  Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed? Explain your reasoning.  Calculate the variability of this distribution.  What is the formal name of the value you computed in (c)?  Suppose the students decide to sample again, this time collecting 90 students per sample, and they again collect 1,000 samples. They build a new distribution of sample proportions. How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 40 observations?      "

When stating an estimate for the population proportion, it is better practice to provide a plausible range of values instead of supplying just the point estimate.    Capturing the Population Parameter  Using only a point estimate is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear. We can throw a spear where we saw a fish, but we will probably miss. On the other hand, if we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish. A confidence interval is like fishing with a net, and it represents a range of plausible values where we are likely to find the population parameter.  If we report a point estimate , we probably will not hit the exact population proportion. On the other hand, if we report a range of plausible values, representing a confidence interval, we have a good shot at capturing the parameter.    If we want to be very certain we capture the population proportion in an interval, should we use a wider interval or a smaller interval?    If we want to be more certain we will capture the fish, we might use a wider net. Likewise, we use a wider confidence interval if we want to be more certain that we capture the parameter.     Twenty-five point estimates and confidence intervals from the simulations in . These intervals are shown relative to the population proportion . Only 1 of these 25 intervals did not capture the population proportion, and this interval has been bolded.   Twenty-five point estimates and confidence intervals from the simulations are shown. These intervals are shown relative to the population proportion p equals 0.88. The point estimates vary around the true population proportion of 0.88, but most of their confidence intervals overlap the value p equals 0.88. One of the 25 intervals does not have a confidence interval that overlaps the population proportion, and this interval has been bolded. We might say that this confidence interval did not capture the parameter p equals 0.88.     Interpreting when an interval doesn't capture the parameter   In , one interval does not contain . Does this imply that the population proportion used in the simulation could not have been ?    Just as some observations naturally occur more than 1.96 standard deviations from the mean, some point estimates will be more than 1.96 standard errors from the parameter of interest. A confidence interval only provides a plausible range of values. While we might say other values are implausible based on the data, this does not mean they are impossible.      Constructing a 95% Confidence Interval  Our sample proportion is the most plausible value of the population proportion, so it makes sense to build a confidence interval around this point estimate. The standard error provides a guide for how large we should make the confidence interval.  The standard error represents the standard deviation of the point estimate, and when the Central Limit Theorem conditions are satisfied, the point estimate closely follows a normal distribution. In a normal distribution, 95% of the data is within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. Using this principle, we can construct a confidence interval that extends 1.96 standard errors from the sample proportion to be 95% confident that the interval captures the population proportion:   But what does 95% confident mean? Suppose we took many samples and built a 95% confidence interval from each. Then about 95% of those intervals would contain the parameter, . shows the process of creating 25 intervals from 25 samples from the simulation in , where 24 of the resulting confidence intervals contain the simulation's population proportion of , and one interval does not.   95% confidence interval for a parameter  When the distribution of a point estimate qualifies for the Central Limit Theorem and therefore closely follows a normal distribution, we can construct a 95% confidence interval as     95% CI for solar energy support   In we learned about a Pew Research poll where 88.7% of a random sample of 1,000 American adults supported expanding the role of solar power. Compute and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion.    We earlier confirmed that follows a normal distribution and has a standard error of . To compute the 95% confidence interval, plug the point estimate and standard error into the 95% confidence interval formula:   We are 95% confident that the actual proportion of American adults who support expanding solar power is between 86.7% and 90.7%. (It's common to round to the nearest percentage point or nearest tenth of a percentage point when reporting a confidence interval.)      Changing the Confidence Level  Suppose we want to consider confidence intervals where the confidence level is higher than 95%, such as a confidence level of 99%. Think back to the analogy about trying to catch a fish: if we want to be more sure that we will catch the fish, we should use a wider net. To create a 99% confidence level, we must also widen our 95% interval. On the other hand, if we want an interval with lower confidence, such as 90%, we could use a slightly narrower interval than our original 95% interval.  The 95% confidence interval structure provides guidance in how to make intervals with different confidence levels. The general 95% confidence interval for a point estimate that follows a normal distribution is   There are three components to this interval: the point estimate, 1.96 , and the standard error. The choice of was based on capturing 95% of the data since the estimate is within 1.96 standard errors of the parameter about 95% of the time. The choice of 1.96 corresponds to a 95% confidence level.    If is a normally distributed random variable, what is the probability of the value being within 2.58 standard deviations of the mean?    This is equivalent to asking how often the Z-score will be larger than -2.58 but less than 2.58. For a picture, see . To determine this probability, we can use statistical software, a calculator, or a table to look up -2.58 and 2.58 for a normal distribution: 0.0049 and 0.9951. Thus, there is a probability that an unobserved normal random variable will be within 2.58 standard deviations of .    This exercise highlights that 99% of the time a normal random variable will be within 2.58 standard deviations of the mean. To create a 99% confidence interval, change 1.96 in the 95% confidence interval formula to be 2.58. That is, the formula for a 99% confidence interval is    The area between and increases as becomes larger. If the confidence level is 99%, we choose such that 99% of a normal normal distribution is between and , which corresponds to 0.5% in the lower tail and 0.5% in the upper tail: .   A standard normal distribution is shown, where standard is the term used to indicate that the normal distribution is centered at 0 and has a standard deviation of 1. Portions of the normal distribution have been shaded. First, the central 95% portion of the distribution has been shaded in a dark blue, and this region has an annotation stating 95%, extends from -1.96 to 1.96. Recall that the value of 1.96 closely matches our 68-95-99.7 rule for the normal distribution, which had stated that about 95% of the area under the normal distribution lied within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Second, a slightly broader region of the normal distribution is shaded, in this case from about -2.5 to positive 2.5, and this has an annotation stating, 99%, extends -2.58 to 2.58. The values described here -- 1.96 and 2.58 -- are the z-star values that we would use for 95% and 99% confidence intervals, respectively.    This approach -- using the Z-scores in the normal model to compute confidence levels -- is appropriate when a point estimate such as is associated with a normal distribution. For some other point estimates, a normal model is not a good fit; in these cases, we'll use alternative distributions that better represent the sampling distribution.   Confidence interval using any confidence level  If a point estimate closely follows a normal model with standard error , then a confidence interval for the population parameter is   where corresponds to the confidence level selected.    provides a picture of how to identify based on a confidence level. We select so that the area between and in the standard normal distribution, , corresponds to the confidence level.   Margin of error  In a confidence interval, is called the margin of error .    90% CI for solar energy support   Use the data in to create a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of American adults that support expanding the use of solar power. We have already verified conditions for normality.    We first find such that 90% of the distribution falls between and in the standard normal distribution, . We can do this using a graphing calculator, statistical software, or a probability table by looking for an upper tail of 5% (the other 5% is in the lower tail): . The 90% confidence interval can then be computed as   That is, we are 90% confident that 87.1% to 90.3% of American adults supported the expansion of solar power in 2018.      More Case Studies  In New York City on October 23rd, 2014, a doctor who had recently been treating Ebola patients in Guinea went to the hospital with a slight fever and was subsequently diagnosed with Ebola. Soon thereafter, an NBC 4 New York\/The Wall Street Journal\/Marist Poll found that 82% of New Yorkers favored a mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone who has come in contact with an Ebola patient . This poll included responses of 1,042 New York adults between Oct 26th and 28th, 2014.    What is the point estimate in this case, and is it reasonable to use a normal distribution to model that point estimate?    The point estimate, based on a sample of size , is . To check whether can be reasonably modeled using a normal distribution, we check independence (the poll is based on a simple random sample) and the success-failure condition ( and , both easily greater than 10). With the conditions met, we are assured that the sampling distribution of can be reasonably modeled using a normal distribution.      Estimate the standard error of from the Ebola survey.    We'll use the substitution approximation of to compute the standard error:       Construct a 95% confidence interval for , the proportion of New York adults who supported a quarantine for anyone who has come into contact with an Ebola patient.    Using the standard error from the previous example, the point estimate 0.82, and for a 95% confidence level, the confidence interval is   We are 95% confident that the proportion of New York adults in October 2014 who supported a quarantine for anyone who had come into contact with an Ebola patient was between 0.796 and 0.844.      Answer the following two questions about the confidence interval from the example above:   What does 95% confident mean in this context?  Do you think the confidence interval is still valid for the opinions of New Yorkers today?       If we took many such samples and computed a 95% confidence interval for each, then about 95% of those intervals would contain the actual proportion of New York adults who supported a quarantine for anyone who has come into contact with an Ebola patient.    Not necessarily. The poll was taken at a time where there was a huge public safety concern. Now that people have had some time to step back, they may have changed their opinions. We would need to run a new poll if we wanted to get an estimate of the current proportion of New York adults who would support such a quarantine period.        In the Pew Research poll about solar energy, they also inquired about other forms of energy, and 84.8% of the 1,000 respondents supported expanding the use of wind turbines.   Is it reasonable to model the proportion of US adults who support expanding wind turbines using a normal distribution?  Create a 99% confidence interval for the level of American support for expanding the use of wind turbines for power generation.       The survey was a random sample and counts are both ( and ), so independence and the success-failure condition are satisfied, and can be modeled using a normal distribution.    We already confirmed that closely follows a normal distribution, so we can use the C.I. formula:   In this case, the point estimate is . For a 99% confidence interval, . Computing the standard error: . Finally, we compute the interval as . It is also important to always provide an interpretation for the interval: we are 99% confident the proportion of American adults that support expanding the use of wind turbines in 2018 is between 81.9% and 87.7%.      We can also construct confidence intervals for other parameters, such as a population mean. In these cases, a confidence interval would be computed in a similar way to that of a single proportion: a point estimate plus\/minus some margin of error. We'll dive into these details in later chapters.   Confidence interval for a single proportion  Once you've determined a one-proportion confidence interval would be helpful for an application, there are four steps to constructing the interval:    Prepare.  Identify and , and determine what confidence level you wish to use.    Check.  Verify the conditions to ensure is nearly normal. For one-proportion confidence intervals, use in place of to check the success-failure condition.    Calculate.  If the conditions hold, compute using , find , and construct the interval.    Conclude.  Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the problem.       Interpreting Confidence Intervals  In each of the examples, we described the confidence intervals by putting them into the context of the data and also using somewhat formal language:    Solar.  We are 90% confident that 87.1% to 90.4% of American adults support the expansion of solar power in 2018.    Ebola.  We are 95% confident that the proportion of New York adults in October 2014 who supported a quarantine for anyone who had come into contact with an Ebola patient was between 0.796 and 0.844.    Wind Turbine.  We are 99% confident the proportion of Americans adults that support expanding the use of wind turbines is between 81.9% and 87.7% in 2018.    First, notice that the statements are always about the population parameter, which considers all American adults for the energy polls or all New York adults for the quarantine poll.  We also avoided another common mistake: incorrect language might try to describe the confidence interval as capturing the population parameter with a certain probability. Making a probability interpretation is a common error: while it might be useful to think of it as a probability, the confidence level only quantifies how plausible it is that the parameter is in the given interval.  Another important consideration of confidence intervals is that they are only about the population parameter . A confidence interval says nothing about individual observations or point estimates. Confidence intervals only provide a plausible range for population parameters.  Lastly, keep in mind the methods we discussed only apply to sampling error, not to bias. If a data set is collected in a way that will tend to systematically under-estimate (or over-estimate) the population parameter, the techniques we have discussed will not address that problem. Instead, we rely on careful data collection procedures to help protect against bias in the examples we have considered, which is a common practice employed by data scientists to combat bias.    Consider the 90% confidence interval for the solar energy survey: 87.1% to 90.4%. If we ran the survey again, can we say that we're 90% confident that the new survey's proportion will be between 87.1% and 90.4%?    No, a confidence interval only provides a range of plausible values for a parameter, not future point estimates.      Section 5.2 Exercises    In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that \"45% of U.S. adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions\". However, this value was based on a sample, so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on its own. The study reported a standard error of about 1.2%, and a normal model may reasonably be used in this setting. Create a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of U.S. adults who live with one or more chronic conditions. Also interpret the confidence interval in the context of the study.      A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter. The standard error for this estimate was 2.4%, and a normal distribution may be used to model the sample proportion. Construct a 99% confidence interval for the fraction of U.S. adult Twitter users who get some news on Twitter, and interpret the confidence interval in context.      In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that \"45% of U.S. adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions\", and the standard error for this estimate is 1.2%. Identify each of the following statements as true or false. Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.   We can say with certainty that the confidence interval from the chronic illness exercise contains the true percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from a chronic illness.  If we repeated this study 1,000 times and constructed a 95% confidence interval for each study, then approximately 950 of those confidence intervals would contain the true fraction of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses.  The poll provides statistically significant evidence (at the level) that the percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses is below 50%.  Since the standard error is 1.2%, only 1.2% of people in the study communicated uncertainty about their answer.       A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter, and the standard error for this estimate was 2.4%. Identify each of the following statements as true or false. Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.   The data provide statistically significant evidence that more than half of U.S. adult Twitter users get some news through Twitter. Use a significance level of . (This part uses concepts from and will be corrected in a future edition.)  Since the standard error is 2.4%, we can conclude that 97.6% of all U.S. adult Twitter users were included in the study.  If we want to reduce the standard error of the estimate, we should collect less data.  If we construct a 90% confidence interval for the percentage of U.S. adult Twitter users who get some news through Twitter, this confidence interval will be wider than a corresponding 99% confidence interval.       A hospital administrator hoping to improve wait times decides to estimate the average emergency room waiting time at her hospital. She collects a simple random sample of 64 patients and determines the time (in minutes) between when they checked in to the ER until they were first seen by a doctor. A 95% confidence interval based on this sample is (128 minutes, 147 minutes), which is based on the normal model for the mean. Determine whether the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.   We are 95% confident that the average waiting time of these 64 emergency room patients is between 128 and 147 minutes.  We are 95% confident that the average waiting time of all patients at this hospital's emergency room is between 128 and 147 minutes.  95% of random samples have a sample mean between 128 and 147 minutes.  A 99% confidence interval would be narrower than the 95% confidence interval since we need to be more sure of our estimate.  The margin of error is 9.5 and the sample mean is 137.5.  In order to decrease the margin of error of a 95% confidence interval to half of what it is now, we would need to double the sample size. (Hint: the margin of error for a mean scales in the same way with sample size as the margin of error for a proportion.)       The General Social Survey asked the question: \"For how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, not good?\" Based on responses from 1,151 US residents, the survey reported a 95% confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days in 2010.   Interpret this interval in context of the data.  What does \"95% confident\" mean? Explain in the context of the application.  Suppose the researchers think a 99% confidence level would be more appropriate for this interval. Will this new interval be smaller or wider than the 95% confidence interval?  If a new survey were to be done with 500 Americans, do you think the standard error of the estimate would be larger, smaller, or about the same.       A website is trying to increase registration for first-time visitors, exposing 1% of these visitors to a new site design. Of 752 randomly sampled visitors over a month who saw the new design, 64 registered.   Check any conditions required for constructing a confidence interval.  Compute the standard error.  Construct and interpret a 90% confidence interval for the fraction of first-time visitors of the site who would register under the new design (assuming stable behaviors by new visitors over time).       A store randomly samples 603 shoppers over the course of a year and finds that 142 of them made their visit because of a coupon they'd received in the mail. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the fraction of all shoppers during the year whose visit was because of a coupon they'd received in the mail.     "

  "title": "Hypothesis Testing for a Proportion",
  "body": " Hypothesis Testing for a Proportion   The following question comes from a book written by Hans Rosling, Anna Rosling Rönnlund, and Ola Rosling called Factfulness :    How many of the world's 1 year old children today have been vaccinated against some disease:    20%  50%  80%    Write down what your answer (or guess), and when you're ready, find the answer in the footnote. The correct answer is (c): 80% of the world's 1 year olds have been vaccinated against some disease.   In this section, we'll be exploring how people with a 4-year college degree perform on this and other world health questions as we learn about hypothesis tests, which are a framework used to rigorously evaluate competing ideas and claims.    Hypothesis testing framework  We're interested in understanding how much people know about world health and development. If we take a multiple choice world health question, then we might like to understand if    :  People never learn these particular topics and their responses are simply equivalent to random guesses.    :  People have knowledge that helps them do better than random guessing, or perhaps, they have false knowledge that leads them to actually do worse than random guessing.    These competing ideas are called hypotheses . We call the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. When there is a subscript 0 like in , data scientists pronounce it as nought (e.g. is pronounced H-nought ).   Null and alternative hypotheses  The null hypothesis ( ) often represents a skeptical perspective or a claim to be tested. The alternative hypothesis ( ) represents an alternative claim under consideration and is often represented by a range of possible parameter values.  Our job as data scientists is to play the role of a skeptic: before we buy into the alternative hypothesis, we need to see strong supporting evidence.   The null hypothesis often represents a skeptical position or a perspective of no difference . In our first example, we'll consider whether the typical person does any different than random guessing on Roslings' question about infant vaccinations.  The alternative hypothesis generally represents a new or stronger perspective. In the case of the question about infant vaccinations, it would certainly be interesting to learn whether people do better than random guessing, since that would mean that the typical person knows something about world health statistics. It would also be very interesting if we learned that people do worse than random guessing, which would suggest people believe incorrect information about world health.  The hypothesis testing framework is a very general tool, and we often use it without a second thought. If a person makes a somewhat unbelievable claim, we are initially skeptical. However, if there is sufficient evidence that supports the claim, we set aside our skepticism and reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. The hallmarks of hypothesis testing are also found in the US court system.    A US court considers two possible claims about a defendant: she is either innocent or guilty. If we set these claims up in a hypothesis framework, which would be the null hypothesis and which the alternative?    The jury considers whether the evidence is so convincing (strong) that there is no reasonable doubt regarding the person's guilt; in such a case, the jury rejects innocence (the null hypothesis) and concludes the defendant is guilty (alternative hypothesis).    Jurors examine the evidence to see whether it convincingly shows a defendant is guilty. Even if the jurors leave unconvinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, this does not mean they believe the defendant is innocent. This is also the case with hypothesis testing: even if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we typically do not accept the null hypothesis as true . Failing to find strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis is not equivalent to accepting the null hypothesis.  When considering Roslings' question about infant vaccination, the null hypothesis represents the notion that the people we will be considering -- college-educated adults -- are as accurate as random guessing. That is, the proportion of respondents who pick the correct answer, that 80% of 1 year olds have been vaccinated against some disease, is about 33.3% (or 1-in-3 if wanting to be perfectly precise). The alternative hypothesis is that this proportion is something other than 33.3%. While it's helpful to write these hypotheses in words, it can be useful to write them using mathematical notation:    :     :     In this hypothesis setup, we want to make a conclusion about the population parameter . The value we are comparing the parameter to is called the null value , which in this case is 0.333. It's common to label the null value with the same symbol as the parameter but with a subscript `0'. That is, in this case, the null value is (pronounced p-nought equals 0.333 ).    It may seem impossible that the proportion of people who get the correct answer is exactly 33.3%. If we don't believe the null hypothesis, should we simply reject it?    No. While we may not buy into the notion that the proportion is exactly 33.3%, the hypothesis testing framework requires that there be strong evidence before we reject the null hypothesis and conclude something more interesting.  After all, even if we don't believe the proportion is exactly 33.3%, that doesn't really tell us anything useful! We would still be stuck with the original question: do people do better or worse than random guessing on Roslings' question? Without data that strongly points in one direction or the other, it is both uninteresting and pointless to reject .      Another example of a real-world hypothesis testing situation is evaluating whether a new drug is better or worse than an existing drug at treating a particular disease. What should we use for the null and alternative hypotheses in this case?    The null hypothesis ( ) in this case is the declaration of no difference : the drugs are equally effective. The alternative hypothesis ( ) is that the new drug performs differently than the original, i.e. it could perform better or worse.      Testing hypotheses using confidence intervals  We will use the Rosling responses data set to evaluate the hypothesis test evaluating whether college-educated adults who get the question about infant vaccination correct is different from 33.3%. This data set summarizes the answers of 50 college-educated adults. Of these 50 adults, 24% of respondents got the question correct that 80% of 1 year olds have been vaccinated against some disease.  Up until now, our discussion has been philosophical. However, now that we have data, we might ask ourselves: does the data provide strong evidence that the proportion of all college-educated adults who would answer this question correctly is different than 33.3%?  We learned in that there is fluctuation from one sample to another, and it is unlikely that our sample proportion, , will exactly equal , but we want to make a conclusion about . We have a nagging concern: is this deviation of 24% from 33.3% simply due to chance, or does the data provide strong evidence that the population proportion is different from 33.3%?  In , we learned how to quantify the uncertainty in our estimate using confidence intervals. The same method for measuring variability can be useful for the hypothesis test.    Check whether it is reasonable to construct a confidence interval for using the sample data, and if so, construct a 95% confidence interval.    The conditions are met for to be approximately normal: the data come from a simple random sample (satisfies independence), and and are both at least 10 (success-failure condition).  To construct the confidence interval, we will need to identify the point estimate ( ), the critical value for the 95% confidence level ( ), and the standard error of ( ). With those pieces, the confidence interval for can be constructed:   We are 95% confident that the proportion of all college-educated adults to correctly answer this particular question about infant vaccination is between 12.2% and 35.8%.    Because the null value in the hypothesis test is , which falls within the range of plausible values from the confidence interval, we cannot say the null value is implausible. Arguably this method is slightly imprecise. As we'll see in a few pages, the standard error is often computed slightly differently in the context of a hypothesis test for a proportion. That is, the data do not provide sufficient evidence to reject the notion that the performance of college-educated adults was different than random guessing, and we do not reject the null hypothesis, .    Explain why we cannot conclude that college-educated adults simply guessed on the infant vaccination question.    While we failed to reject , that does not necessarily mean the null hypothesis is true. Perhaps there was an actual difference, but we were not able to detect it with the relatively small sample of 50.     Double negatives can sometimes be used in statistics  In many statistical explanations, we use double negatives. For instance, we might say that the null hypothesis is not implausible or we failed to reject the null hypothesis. Double negatives are used to communicate that while we are not rejecting a position, we are also not saying it is correct.     Let's move onto a second question posed by the Roslings:    There are 2 billion children in the world today aged 0-15 years old, how many children will there be in year 2100 according to the United Nations?    4 billion.  3 billion.  2 billion.    Set up appropriate hypotheses to evaluate whether college-educated adults are better than random guessing on this question. Also, see if you can guess the correct answer before checking the answer in the solution!    The appropriate hypotheses are:   : the proportion who get the answer correct is the same as random guessing: 1-in-3, or .   : the proportion who get the answer correct is different than random guessing, .  The correct answer to the question is 2 billion. While the world population is projected to increase, the average age is also expected to rise. That is, the majority of the population growth will happen in older age groups, meaning people are projected to live longer in the future across much of the world.      This time we took a larger sample of 228 college-educated adults, 34 (14.9%) selected the correct answer to the question above: 2 billion. Can we model the sample proportion using a normal distribution and construct a confidence interval?    We check both conditions, which are satisfied, so it is reasonable to use a normal distribution for :   Independence. Since the data are from a simple random sample, the observations are independent.   Success-failure. We'll use in place of to check: and . Both are greater than 10, so the success-failure condition is satisfied.      Compute a 95% confidence interval for the fraction of college-educated adults who answered the children-in-2100 question correctly, and evaluate the hypotheses from the previous exercise.    To compute the standard error, we'll again use in place of for the calculation:   In the previous exercise, we found that can be modeled using a normal distribution, which ensures a 95% confidence interval may be accurately constructed as   Because the null value, , is not in the confidence interval, a population proportion of 0.333 is implausible and we reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data provide statistically significant evidence that the actual proportion of college adults who get the children-in-2100 question correct is different from random guessing. Because the entire 95% confidence interval is below 0.333, we can conclude college-educated adults do worse than random guessing on this question.  One subtle consideration is that we used a 95% confidence interval. What if we had used a 99% confidence level? Or even a 99.9% confidence level? It's possible to come to a different conclusion if using a different confidence level. Therefore, when we make a conclusion based on confidence interval, we should also be sure it is clear what confidence level we used.    The worse-than-random performance on this last question is not a fluke: there are many such world health questions where people do worse than random guessing. In general, the answers suggest that people tend to be more pessimistic about progress than reality suggests. This topic is discussed in much greater detail in the Roslings' book, Factfulness .    Decision errors  Hypothesis tests are not flawless: we can make an incorrect decision in a statistical hypothesis test based on the data. For example, in the court system innocent people are sometimes wrongly convicted and the guilty sometimes walk free. One key distinction with statistical hypothesis tests is that we have the tools necessary to probabilistically quantify how often we make errors in our conclusions.  Recall that there are two competing hypotheses: the null and the alternative. In a hypothesis test, we make a statement about which one might be true, but we might choose incorrectly. There are four possible scenarios, which are summarized in .   Four different scenarios for hypothesis tests.      Test conclusion      do not reject  reject in favor of     true  okay  Type 1 Error    Truth  true  Type 2 Error  okay     A Type 1 Error is rejecting the null hypothesis when is actually true. A Type 2 Error is failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative is actually true.    In a US court, the defendant is either innocent ( ) or guilty ( ). What does a Type 1 Error represent in this context? What does a Type 2 Error represent? may be useful.    If the court makes a Type 1 Error, this means the defendant is innocent ( true) but wrongly convicted. Note that a Type 1 Error is only possible if we've rejected the null hypothesis.  A Type 2 Error means the court failed to reject (i.e. failed to convict the person) when she was in fact guilty ( true). Note that a Type 2 Error is only possible if we have failed to reject the null hypothesis.      How could we reduce the Type 1 Error rate in US courts? What influence would this have on the Type 2 Error rate?    To lower the Type 1 Error rate, we might raise our standard for conviction from beyond a reasonable doubt to beyond a conceivable doubt so fewer people would be wrongly convicted. However, this would also make it more difficult to convict the people who are actually guilty, so we would make more Type 2 Errors.      How could we reduce the Type 2 Error rate in US courts? What influence would this have on the Type 1 Error rate?    To lower the Type 2 Error rate, we want to convict more guilty people. We could lower the standards for conviction from beyond a reasonable doubt to beyond a little doubt . Lowering the bar for guilt will also result in more wrongful convictions, raising the Type 1 Error rate.    The previous exercises provide an important lesson: if we reduce how often we make one type of error, we generally make more of the other type.  Hypothesis testing is built around rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis. That is, we do not reject unless we have strong evidence. But what precisely does strong evidence mean? As a general rule of thumb, for those cases where the null hypothesis is actually true, we do not want to incorrectly reject more than 5% of the time. This corresponds to a significance level of 0.05. That is, if the null hypothesis is true, the significance level indicates how often the data lead us to incorrectly reject . We often write the significance level using (the Greek letter alpha ): . We discuss the appropriateness of different significance levels in .  If we use a 95% confidence interval to evaluate a hypothesis test and the null hypothesis happens to be true, we will make an error whenever the point estimate is at least 1.96 standard errors away from the population parameter. This happens about 5% of the time (2.5% in each tail). Similarly, using a 99% confidence interval to evaluate a hypothesis is equivalent to a significance level of .  A confidence interval is very helpful in determining whether or not to reject the null hypothesis. However, the confidence interval approach isn't always sustainable. In several sections, we will encounter situations where a confidence interval cannot be constructed. For example, if we wanted to evaluate the hypothesis that several proportions are equal, it isn't clear how to construct and compare many confidence intervals altogether.  Next we will introduce a statistic called the p-value to help us expand our statistical toolkit, which will enable us to both better understand the strength of evidence and work in more complex data scenarios in later sections.    Formal Testing Using P-values   P-value   The p-value is the probability of observing data at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as our current data set, if the null hypothesis were true. We typically use a summary statistic of the data, such as the sample proportion, to help compute the p-value.     Significance Level   The significance level  indicates how often we incorrectly reject when it is true. The traditional significance level is .    When evaluating hypotheses for proportions using the p-value method, we use the null value (not ) when checking the success-failure condition and computing the standard error:    When using the p-value method to evaluate a hypothesis test, check the success-failure condition using the null value instead of using the sample proportion. We're supposing the null hypothesis is true, which is different from the confidence interval approach.   To compute a p-value:   Calculate the Z-score (standardized test statistic):  Find the probability of observing a Z-score at least as extreme as the one calculated, using the standard normal distribution.  For a two-sided test, double the tail probability.    P-value for coal energy test   Using the coal energy data ( , ), compute the p-value for testing versus .    First, check conditions using :   Calculate the standard error using :   Compute the Z-score:   This is an extremely large Z-score in magnitude. The probability of observing a Z-score this extreme (in either tail) is essentially 0. Therefore, .  Since the p-value is much less than 0.05, we reject . We have extremely strong evidence that a majority of American adults oppose expanding coal energy production.     Nuclear arms reduction support   A Gallup poll conducted in March 2013 found that 56% of a simple random sample of 1,028 US adults supported nuclear arms reduction. Does this provide convincing evidence that a majority of Americans supported nuclear arms reduction at the 5% significance level?    Set up hypotheses. We want to test whether a majority (more than 50%) support nuclear arms reduction:    Check conditions:    Independence: The poll was a simple random sample, so observations are independent.  Success-failure: Using the null proportion : .    Calculate: Compute the standard error using :   Calculate the test statistic:   For this two-sided test, we need to find the probability in both tails. A Z-score of 3.85 is extremely large. Looking at a standard normal table, the upper tail area is approximately 0.0001. Doubling this for the two-sided test: .   Conclude: Since , we reject . The poll provides convincing evidence that a majority of Americans supported nuclear arms reduction efforts in March 2013.     The sampling distribution centered at the null value for the nuclear arms test. The tails beyond the observed proportion show the p-value.   Normal distribution centered at 0.5 showing tail areas for nuclear arms test     The p-value for the coal energy test, shown as the tail areas beyond the observed Z-score.

Check: Verify conditions to ensure is nearly normal under . For one-proportion hypothesis tests, use the null value to check the success-failure condition.  Calculate: If the conditions hold, compute the standard error using , compute the Z-score, and identify the p-value.  Conclude: Evaluate the hypothesis test by comparing the p-value to , and provide a conclusion in the context of the problem.    Decision rule:   If , reject and conclude there is strong evidence for .  If , do not reject and conclude there is insufficient evidence for .     Choosing a Significance Level  Choosing a significance level for a test is important in many contexts, and the traditional level is . However, it can be helpful to adjust the significance level based on the application. We may select a level that is smaller or larger than 0.05 depending on the consequences of any conclusions reached from the test.  If making a Type 1 Error is dangerous or especially costly, we should choose a small significance level (e.g. 0.01). Under this scenario we want to be very cautious about rejecting the null hypothesis, so we demand very strong evidence favoring before we would reject .  If a Type 2 Error is relatively more dangerous or much more costly than a Type 1 Error, then we might choose a higher significance level (e.g. 0.10). Here we want to be cautious about failing to reject when the alternative hypothesis is actually true.  Additionally, if the cost of collecting data is small relative to the cost of a Type 2 Error, then it may also be a good strategy to collect more data. Under this strategy, the Type 2 Error can be reduced while not affecting the Type 1 Error rate. Of course, collecting extra data is often costly, so there is typically a cost-benefit analysis to be considered.    One-Sided Hypothesis Tests (Special Topic)  So far we've only considered what are called two-sided hypothesis tests , where we care about detecting whether is either above or below some null value . There is a second type of hypothesis test called a one-sided hypothesis test .  For a one-sided hypothesis test, the hypotheses take one of the following forms:   There's only value in detecting if the population parameter is less than some value . In this case, the alternative hypothesis is written as for some null value .  There's only value in detecting if the population parameter is more than some value : In this case, the alternative hypothesis is written as .   While we adjust the form of the alternative hypothesis, we continue to write the null hypothesis using an equals-sign in the one-sided hypothesis test case.  In the entire hypothesis testing procedure, there is only one difference in evaluating a one-sided hypothesis test vs a two-sided hypothesis test: how to compute the p-value. In a one-sided hypothesis test, we compute the p-value as the tail area in the direction of the alternative hypothesis only , meaning it is represented by a single tail area. Herein lies the reason why one-sided tests are sometimes interesting: if we don't have to double the tail area to get the p-value, then the p-value is smaller and the level of evidence required to identify an interesting finding in the direction of the alternative hypothesis goes down. However, one-sided tests aren't all sunshine and rainbows: the heavy price paid is that any interesting findings in the opposite direction must be disregarded.    In Section , we encountered an example where doctors were interested in determining whether stents would help people who had a high risk of stroke. The researchers believed the stents would help. Unfortunately, the data showed the opposite: patients who received stents actually did worse. Why was using a two-sided test so important in this context?    Before the study, researchers had reason to believe that stents would help patients since existing research suggested stents helped in patients with heart attacks. It would surely have been tempting to use a one-sided test in this situation, and had they done this, they would have limited their ability to identify potential harm to patients.    This example highlights that using a one-sided hypothesis creates a risk of overlooking data supporting the opposite conclusion. We could have made a similar error when reviewing the Roslings' question data in this section; if we had a pre-conceived notion that college-educated people wouldn't do worse than random guessing and so used a one-sided test, we would have missed the really interesting finding that many people have incorrect knowledge about global public health.  When might a one-sided test be appropriate to use? Very rarely. Should you ever find yourself considering using a one-sided test, carefully answer the following question:    What would I, or others, conclude if the data happens to go clearly in the opposite direction than my alternative hypothesis?    If you or others would find any value in making a conclusion about the data that goes in the opposite direction of a one-sided test, then a two-sided hypothesis test should actually be used. These considerations can be subtle, so exercise caution. We will only apply two-sided tests in the rest of this book.    Why can't we simply run a one-sided test that goes in the direction of the data?    We've been building a careful framework that controls for the Type 1 Error, which is the significance level in a hypothesis test. We'll use the below to keep things simple.  Imagine we could pick the one-sided test after we saw the data. What will go wrong?   If is smaller than the null value, then a one-sided test where would mean that any observation in the lower 5% tail of the null distribution would lead to us rejecting .  If is larger than the null value, then a one-sided test where would mean that any observation in the upper 5% tail of the null distribution would lead to us rejecting .   Then if were true, there's a 10% chance of being in one of the two tails, so our testing error is actually , not 0.05. That is, not being careful about when to use one-sided tests effectively undermines the methods we're working so hard to develop and utilize.     Use one-sided tests only when you have a strong reason to care about deviations in only one direction. If you're unsure, use a two-sided test.     Statistical Significance versus Practical Significance  When the sample size becomes larger, point estimates become more precise and any real differences in the mean and null value become easier to detect and recognize. Even a very small difference would likely be detected if we took a large enough sample. Sometimes researchers will take such large samples that even the slightest difference is detected, even differences where there is no practical value. In such cases, we still say the difference is statistically significant , but it is not practically significant .  For example, an online experiment might identify that placing additional ads on a movie review website statistically significantly increases viewership of a TV show by 0.001%, but this increase might not have any practical value.  One role of a data scientist in conducting a study often includes planning the size of the study. The data scientist might first consult experts or scientific literature to learn what would be the smallest meaningful difference from the null value. She also would obtain other information, such as a very rough estimate of the true proportion , so that she could roughly estimate the standard error. From here, she can suggest a sample size that is sufficiently large that, if there is a real difference that is meaningful, we could detect it. While larger sample sizes may still be used, these calculations are especially helpful when considering costs or potential risks, such as possible health impacts to volunteers in a medical study.    Section 5.3 Exercises    Write the null and alternative hypotheses in words and then symbols for each of the following situations.   A tutoring company would like to understand if most students tend to improve their grades (or not) after they use their services. They sample 200 of the students who used their service in the past year and ask them if their grades have improved or declined from the previous year.  Employers at a firm are worried about the effect of March Madness, a basketball championship held each spring in the US, on employee productivity. They estimate that on a regular business day employees spend on average 15 minutes of company time checking personal email, making personal phone calls, etc. They also collect data on how much company time employees spend on such non-business activities during March Madness. They want to determine if these data provide convincing evidence that employee productivity changed during March Madness.       Write the null and alternative hypotheses in words and using symbols for each of the following situations.   Since 2008, chain restaurants in California have been required to display calorie counts of each menu item. Prior to menus displaying calorie counts, the average calorie intake of diners at a restaurant was 1100 calories. After calorie counts started to be displayed on menus, a nutritionist collected data on the number of calories consumed at this restaurant from a random sample of diners. Do these data provide convincing evidence of a difference in the average calorie intake of diners at this restaurant?  The state of Wisconsin would like to understand the fraction of its adult residents that consumed alcohol in the last year, specifically if the rate is different from the national rate of 70%. To help them answer this question, they conduct a random sample of 852 residents and ask them about their alcohol consumption.       A study suggests that 60% of college students spend 10 or more hours per week communicating with others online. You believe that this is incorrect and decide to collect your own sample for a hypothesis test. You randomly sample 160 students from your dorm and find that 70% spent 10 or more hours a week communicating with others online. A friend of yours, who offers to help you with the hypothesis test, comes up with the following set of hypotheses. Indicate any errors you see.       A study suggests that 25% of 25 year olds have gotten married. You believe that this is incorrect and decide to collect your own sample for a hypothesis test. From a random sample of 25 year olds in census data with size 776, you find that 24% of them are married. A friend of yours offers to help you with setting up the hypothesis test and comes up with the following hypotheses. Indicate any errors you see.       Teens were surveyed about cyberbullying, and 54% to 64% reported experiencing cyberbullying (95% confidence interval). Answer the following questions based on this interval.   A newspaper claims that a majority of teens have experienced cyberbullying. Is this claim supported by the confidence interval? Explain your reasoning.  A researcher conjectured that 70% of teens have experienced cyberbullying. Is this claim supported by the confidence interval? Explain your reasoning.  Without actually calculating the interval, determine if the claim of the researcher from part (b) would be supported based on a 90% confidence interval?       The ER wait time exercise provides a 95% confidence interval for the mean waiting time at an emergency room (ER) of (128 minutes, 147 minutes). Answer the following questions based on this interval.   A local newspaper claims that the average waiting time at this ER exceeds 3 hours. Is this claim supported by the confidence interval? Explain your reasoning.  The Dean of Medicine at this hospital claims the average wait time is 2.2 hours. Is this claim supported by the confidence interval? Explain your reasoning.  Without actually calculating the interval, determine if the claim of the Dean from part (b) would be supported based on a 99% confidence interval?       Do a majority of US adults believe raising the minimum wage will help the economy, or is there a majority who do not believe this? A Rasmussen Reports survey of a random sample of 1,000 US adults found that 42% believe it will help the economy. Conduct an appropriate hypothesis test to help answer the research question.      400 students were randomly sampled from a large university, and 289 said they did not get enough sleep. Conduct a hypothesis test to check whether this represents a statistically significant difference from 50%, and use a significance level of 0.01.      You are given the following hypotheses:   We know the sample size is 90. For what sample proportion would the p-value be equal to 0.05? Assume that all conditions necessary for inference are satisfied.      You are given the following hypotheses:   We know that the sample size is 1,429. For what sample proportion would the p-value be equal to 0.01? Assume that all conditions necessary for inference are satisfied.      A patient named Diana was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a long-term syndrome of body pain, and was prescribed anti-depressants. Being the skeptic that she is, Diana didn't initially believe that anti-depressants would help her symptoms. However after a couple months of being on the medication she decides that the anti-depressants are working, because she feels like her symptoms are in fact getting better.   Write the hypotheses in words for Diana's skeptical position when she started taking the anti-depressants.  What is a Type 1 Error in this context?  What is a Type 2 Error in this context?

  "body": " Chapter 5 Review Exercises  This chapter introduced the foundational concepts of statistical inference:   Point estimates provide single best guesses for population parameters, but come with sampling error.  Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for parameters, accounting for sampling variability.  Hypothesis tests allow us to formally evaluate claims about population parameters using sample data.   These methods all rely on the Central Limit Theorem, which tells us that sample proportions follow an approximately normal distribution when certain conditions are met. The same framework extends to other parameters beyond proportions.   Review Exercises    The General Social Survey asked the question: After an average work day, about how many hours do you have to relax or pursue activities that you enjoy? to a random sample of 1,155 Americans. A 95% confidence interval for the mean number of hours spent relaxing or pursuing activities they enjoy was (1.38, 1.92).   Interpret this interval in context of the data.  Suppose another set of researchers reported a confidence interval with a larger margin of error based on the same sample of 1,155 Americans. How does their confidence level compare to the confidence level of the interval stated above?  Suppose next year a new survey asking the same question is conducted, and this time the sample size is 2,500. Assuming that the population characteristics, with respect to how much time people spend relaxing after work, have not changed much within a year, how will the margin of error of the 95% confidence interval constructed based on data from the new survey compare to the margin of error of the interval stated above?       In , we learned that a Rasmussen Reports survey of 1,000 US adults found that 42% believe raising the minimum wage will help the economy. Construct a 99% confidence interval for the true proportion of US adults who believe this.      A food safety inspector is called upon to investigate a restaurant with a few customer reports of poor sanitation practices. The food safety inspector uses a hypothesis testing framework to evaluate whether regulations are not being met.

What is a Type 2 Error in this context?  Which error is more problematic for the restaurant owner? Why?  Which error is more problematic for the diners? Why?  As a diner, would you prefer that the food safety inspector requires strong evidence or very strong evidence of health concerns before revoking a restaurant's license? Explain your reasoning.       Determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning. If false, state how it could be corrected.   If a given value (for example, the null hypothesized value of a parameter) is within a 95% confidence interval, it will also be within a 99% confidence interval.  Decreasing the significance level ( ) will increase the probability of making a Type 1 Error.  Suppose the null hypothesis is and we fail to reject . Under this scenario, the true population proportion is 0.5.  With large sample sizes, even small differences between the null value and the observed point estimate, a difference often called the effect size, will be identified as statistically significant.

  "body": " Inference for a single proportion   We encountered inference methods for a single proportion in Chapter 5, exploring point estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests. In this section, we'll do a review of these topics and also how to choose an appropriate sample size when collecting data for single proportion contexts.    Identifying when the sample proportion is nearly normal  A sample proportion can be modeled using a normal distribution when the sample observations are independent and the sample size is sufficiently large.   Sampling distribution of  The sampling distribution for based on a sample of size from a population with a true proportion is nearly normal when:   The sample's observations are independent, e.g. are from a simple random sample.  We expected to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, i.e. and . This is called the success-failure condition .   When these conditions are met, then the sampling distribution of is nearly normal with mean and standard error .   Typically we don't know the true proportion , so we substitute some value to check conditions and estimate the standard error. For confidence intervals, the sample proportion is used to check the success-failure condition and compute the standard error. For hypothesis tests, typically the null value that is, the proportion claimed in the null hypothesis is used in place of .    Confidence intervals for a proportion  A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the parameter , and when can be modeled using a normal distribution, the confidence interval for takes the form     A simple random sample of 826 payday loan borrowers was surveyed to better understand their interests around regulation and costs. 70% of the responses supported new regulations on payday lenders. Is it reasonable to model using a normal distribution?    The data are a random sample, so the observations are independent and representative of the population of interest.  We also must check the success-failure condition, which we do using in place of when computing a confidence interval:   Since both values are at least 10, we can use the normal distribution to model .      Estimate the standard error of . Because is unknown and the standard error is for a confidence interval, use in place of in the formula.     .      Construct a 95% confidence interval for , the proportion of payday borrowers who support increased regulation for payday lenders.    Using the point estimate 0.70, for a 95% confidence interval, and the standard error from Guided Practice , the confidence interval is   We are 95% confident that the true proportion of payday borrowers who supported regulation at the time of the poll was between 0.669 and 0.731.     Confidence interval for a single proportion  Once you've determined a one-proportion confidence interval would be helpful for an application, there are four steps to constructing the interval:    Prepare.  Identify and , and determine what confidence level you wish to use.    Check.  Verify the conditions to ensure is nearly normal. For one-proportion confidence intervals, use in place of to check the success-failure condition.    Calculate.  If the conditions hold, compute using , find , and construct the interval.    Conclude.  Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the problem.     For additional one-proportion confidence interval examples, see Section 5.2.    Hypothesis testing for a proportion  One possible regulation for payday lenders is that they would be required to do a credit check and evaluate debt payments against the borrower's finances. We would like to know: would borrowers support this form of regulation?    Set up hypotheses to evaluate whether borrowers have a majority support or majority opposition for this type of regulation.     : . : .    To apply the normal distribution framework in the context of a hypothesis test for a proportion, the independence and success-failure conditions must be satisfied. In a hypothesis test, the success-failure condition is checked using the null proportion: we verify and are at least 10, where is the null value.    Do payday loan borrowers support a regulation that would require lenders to pull their credit report and evaluate their debt payments? From a random sample of 826 borrowers, 51% said they would support such a regulation. Is it reasonable to model using a normal distribution for a hypothesis test here?    Independence holds since the poll is based on a random sample. The success-failure condition also holds, which is checked using the null value ( ) from : , .      Using the hypotheses and data from Guided Practice and , evaluate whether the poll provides convincing evidence that a majority of payday loan borrowers support a new regulation that would require lenders to pull credit reports and evaluate debt payments.    With hypotheses already set up and conditions checked, we can move onto calculations. The standard error in the context of a one-proportion hypothesis test is computed using the null value, :   A picture of the normal model is shown below with the p-value represented by the shaded region.   A normal distribution is shown with a center of 0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.017. Two tails are shaded: The region above 0.51 and a region in the corresponding lower tail. Visually, it looks like a little over half of the area under the normal curve is shaded.    Based on the normal model, the test statistic can be computed as the Z-score of the point estimate:   The single tail area is 0.2776, and the p-value, represented by both tail areas together, is 0.5552. Because the p-value is larger than 0.05, we do not reject . The poll does not provide convincing evidence that a majority of payday loan borrowers support or oppose regulations around credit checks and evaluation of debt payments.     Hypothesis testing for a single proportion  Once you've determined a one-proportion hypothesis test is the correct procedure, there are four steps to completing the test:    Prepare.  Identify the parameter of interest, list hypotheses, identify the significance level, and identify and .    Check.  Verify conditions to ensure is nearly normal under . For one-proportion hypothesis tests, use the null value to check the success-failure condition.    Calculate.  If the conditions hold, compute the standard error, again using , compute the Z-score, and identify the p-value.    Conclude.  Evaluate the hypothesis test by comparing the p-value to , and provide a conclusion in the context of the problem.     For additional one-proportion hypothesis test examples, see Section 5.3.    When one or more conditions aren't met  We've spent a lot of time discussing conditions for when can be reasonably modeled by a normal distribution. What happens when the success-failure condition fails? What about when the independence condition fails? In either case, the general ideas of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests remain the same, but the strategy or technique used to generate the interval or p-value change.  When the success-failure condition isn't met for a hypothesis test, we can simulate the null distribution of using the null value, . The simulation concept is similar to the ideas used in the malaria case study presented in Section 5.1, and an online section outlines this strategy: www.openintro.org\/r?go=stat_sim_prop_ht   For a confidence interval when the success-failure condition isn't met, we can use what's called the Clopper-Pearson interval . The details are beyond the scope of this book. However, there are many internet resources covering this topic.  The independence condition is a more nuanced requirement. When it isn't met, it is important to understand how and why it isn't met. For example, if we took a cluster sample (see Section 1.3), suitable statistical methods are available but would be beyond the scope of even most second or third courses in statistics. On the other hand, we'd be stretched to find any method that we could confidently apply to correct the inherent biases of data from a convenience sample.  While this book is scoped to well-constrained statistical problems, do remember that this is just the first book in what is a large library of statistical methods that are suitable for a very wide range of data and contexts.    Choosing a sample size when estimating a proportion  When collecting data, we choose a sample size suitable for the purpose of the study. Often times this means choosing a sample size large enough that the margin of error which is the part we add and subtract from the point estimate in a confidence interval is sufficiently small that the sample is useful. For example, our task might be to find a sample size so that the sample proportion is within of the actual proportion in a 95% confidence interval.    A university newspaper is conducting a survey to determine what fraction of students support a $200 per year increase in fees to pay for a new football stadium. How big of a sample is required to ensure the margin of error is smaller than 0.04 using a 95% confidence level?    The margin of error for a sample proportion is   Our goal is to find the smallest sample size so that this margin of error is smaller than 0.04. For a 95% confidence level, the value corresponds to 1.96:   There are two unknowns in the equation: and . If we have an estimate of , perhaps from a prior survey, we could enter in that value and solve for . If we have no such estimate, we must use some other value for . It turns out that the margin of error is largest when is 0.5, so we typically use this worst case value if no estimate of the proportion is available:   We would need over 600.25 participants, which means we need 601 participants or more, to ensure the sample proportion is within 0.04 of the true proportion with 95% confidence.    When an estimate of the proportion is available, we use it in place of the worst case proportion value, 0.5.    A manager is about to oversee the mass production of a new tire model in her factory, and she would like to estimate what proportion of these tires will be rejected through quality control. The quality control team has monitored the last three tire models produced by the factory, failing 1.7% of tires in the first model, 6.2% of the second model, and 1.3% of the third model. The manager would like to examine enough tires to estimate the failure rate of the new tire model to within about 1% with a 90% confidence level. There are three different failure rates to choose from. Perform the sample size computation for each separately, and identify three sample sizes to consider.    For a 90% confidence interval, , and since an estimate of the proportion 0.017 is available, we'll use it in the margin of error formula:   For sample size calculations, we always round up, so the first tire model suggests 453 tires would be sufficient.  A similar computation can be accomplished using 0.062 and 0.013 for , and you should verify that using these proportions results in minimum sample sizes of 1574 and 348 tires, respectively.      The sample sizes vary widely in Guided Practice . Which of the three would you suggest using? What would influence your choice?    We could examine which of the old models is most like the new model, then choose the corresponding sample size. Or if two of the previous estimates are based on small samples while the other is based on a larger sample, we might consider the value corresponding to the larger sample. There are also other reasonable approaches.  Also observe that the success-failure condition would need to be checked in the final sample. For instance, if we sampled tires and found a failure rate of 0.5%, the normal approximation would not be reasonable, and we would require more advanced statistical methods for creating the confidence interval.      Suppose we want to continually track the support of payday borrowers for regulation on lenders, where we would conduct a new poll every month. Running such frequent polls is expensive, so we decide a wider margin of error of 5% for each individual survey would be acceptable. Based on the original sample of borrowers where 70% supported some form of regulation, how big should our monthly sample be for a margin of error of 0.05 with 95% confidence?    We complete the same computations as before, except now we use 0.70 instead of 0.5 for :   A sample size of 323 or more would be reasonable. (Reminder: always round up for sample size calculations!) Given that we plan to track this poll over time, we also may want to periodically repeat these calculations to ensure that we're being thoughtful in our sample size recommendations in case the baseline rate fluctuates.

In our investigations, we'll identify a reasonable point estimate of based on the sample, and you may have already guessed its form: . Next, we'll apply the same processes we used in the single-proportion context: we verify that the point estimate can be modeled using a normal distribution, we compute the estimate's standard error, and we apply our inferential framework.    Sampling distribution of the difference of two proportions  Like with , the difference of two sample proportions can be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met. First, we require a broader independence condition, and secondly, the success-failure condition must be met by both groups.   Conditions for the sampling distribution of to be normal  The difference can be modeled using a normal distribution when    Independence, extended. The data are independent within and between the two groups. Generally this is satisfied if the data come from two independent random samples or if the data come from a randomized experiment.   Success-failure condition. The success-failure condition holds for both groups, where we check successes and failures in each group separately.   When these conditions are satisfied, the standard error of is   where and represent the population proportions, and and represent the sample sizes.     Confidence intervals for  We can apply the generic confidence interval formula for a difference of two proportions, where we use as the point estimate and substitute the formula:   We can also follow the same Prepare, Check, Calculate, Conclude steps for computing a confidence interval or completing a hypothesis test. The details change a little, but the general approach remain the same. Think about these steps when you apply statistical methods.    We consider an experiment for patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. These patients were randomly divided into a treatment group where they received a blood thinner or the control group where they did not receive a blood thinner. The outcome variable of interest was whether the patients survived for at least 24 hours. The results are shown in . Check whether we can model the difference in sample proportions using the normal distribution.    We first check for independence: since this is a randomized experiment, this condition is satisfied.  Next, we check the success-failure condition for each group. We have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each experiment arm (11, 14, 39, 26), so this condition is also satisfied.  With both conditions satisfied, the difference in sample proportions can be reasonably modeled using a normal distribution for these data.     Results for the CPR study. Patients in the treatment group were given a blood thinner, and patients in the control group were not.     Survived  Died  Total    Control  11  39  50    Treatment  14  26  40    Total  25  65  90       Create and interpret a 90% confidence interval of the difference for the survival rates in the CPR study.    We'll use for the survival rate in the treatment group and for the control group:   We use the standard error formula provided on page . As with the one-sample proportion case, we use the sample estimates of each proportion in the formula in the confidence interval context:   For a 90% confidence interval, we use :   We are 90% confident that blood thinners have a difference of -2.6% to +28.6% percentage point impact on survival rate for patients who are like those in the study. Because 0% is contained in the interval, we do not have enough information to say whether blood thinners help or harm heart attack patients who have been admitted after they have undergone CPR.      A 5-year experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of fish oils on reducing cardiovascular events, where each subject was randomized into one of two treatment groups. We'll consider heart attack outcomes in these patients:      heart attack  no event  Total    fish oil  145  12788  12933    placebo  200  12738  12938     Create a 95% confidence interval for the effect of fish oils on heart attacks for patients who are well-represented by those in the study. Also interpret the interval in the context of the study.    Because the patients were randomized, the subjects are independent, both within and between the two groups. The success-failure condition is also met for both groups as all counts are at least 10. This satisfies the conditions necessary to model the difference in proportions using a normal distribution.  Compute the sample proportions ( , ), point estimate of the difference ( ), and standard error ( ). Next, plug the values into the general formula for a confidence interval, where we'll use a 95% confidence level with :   We are 95% confident that fish oils decreases heart attacks by 0.15 to 0.71 percentage points (off of a baseline of about 1.55%) over a 5-year period for subjects who are similar to those in the study. Because the interval is entirely below 0, the data provide strong evidence that fish oil supplements reduce heart attacks in patients like those in the study.      Hypothesis tests for the difference of two proportions  A mammogram is an X-ray procedure used to check for breast cancer. Whether mammograms should be used is part of a controversial discussion, and it's the topic of our next example where we learn about 2-proportion hypothesis tests when is (or equivalently, ).  A 30-year study was conducted with nearly 90,000 female participants. During a 5-year screening period, each woman was randomized to one of two groups: in the first group, women received regular mammograms to screen for breast cancer, and in the second group, women received regular non-mammogram breast cancer exams. No intervention was made during the following 25 years of the study, and we'll consider death resulting from breast cancer over the full 30-year period. Results from the study are summarized in .  If mammograms are much more effective than non-mammogram breast cancer exams, then we would expect to see additional deaths from breast cancer in the control group. On the other hand, if mammograms are not as effective as regular breast cancer exams, we would expect to see an increase in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram group.   Summary results for breast cancer study.      Death from breast cancer?      Yes  No    Mammogram   500  44,425    Control   505  44,405       Is this study an experiment or an observational study?    This is an experiment. Patients were randomized to receive mammograms or a standard breast cancer exam. We will be able to make causal conclusions based on this study.      Set up hypotheses to test whether there was a difference in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram and control groups.     : the breast cancer death rate for patients screened using mammograms is the same as the breast cancer death rate for patients in the control, .   : the breast cancer death rate for patients screened using mammograms is different than the breast cancer death rate for patients in the control, .    In Example , we will check the conditions for using a normal distribution to analyze the results of the study. The details are very similar to that of confidence intervals. However, when the null hypothesis is that , we use a special proportion called the pooled proportion to check the success-failure condition:   This proportion is an estimate of the breast cancer death rate across the entire study, and it's our best estimate of the proportions and  if the null hypothesis is true that . We will also use this pooled proportion when computing the standard error.    Is it reasonable to model the difference in proportions using a normal distribution in this study?    Because the patients are randomized, they can be treated as independent, both within and between groups. We also must check the success-failure condition for each group. Under the null hypothesis, the proportions and are equal, so we check the success-failure condition with our best estimate of these values under , the pooled proportion from the two samples, :   The success-failure condition is satisfied since all values are at least 10. With both conditions satisfied, we can safely model the difference in proportions using a normal distribution.     Use the pooled proportion when is  When the null hypothesis is that the proportions are equal, use the pooled proportion ( ) to verify the success-failure condition and estimate the standard error:   Here represents the number of successes in sample 1 since   Similarly, represents the number of successes in sample 2.   In Example , the pooled proportion was used to check the success-failure condition. For an example of a two-proportion hypothesis test that does not require the success-failure condition to be met, see Section . In the next example, we see the second place where the pooled proportion comes into play: the standard error calculation.    Compute the point estimate of the difference in breast cancer death rates in the two groups, and use the pooled proportion to calculate the standard error.    The point estimate of the difference in breast cancer death rates is   The breast cancer death rate in the mammogram group was 0.012% less than in the control group. Next, the standard error is calculated using the pooled proportion , :       Using the point estimate and standard error , calculate a p-value for the hypothesis test and write a conclusion.    Just like in past tests, we first compute a test statistic and draw a picture:    A normal distribution is shown centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 0.0007. The lower tail is shaded below -0.00012 and the upper tail is shaded above 0.00012. Visually, it looks like very roughly 90% of the area under the normal distribution is shaded.    The lower tail area is 0.4325, which we double to get the p-value: 0.8650. Because this p-value is larger than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, the difference in breast cancer death rates is reasonably explained by chance, and we do not observe benefits or harm from mammograms relative to a regular breast exam.    Can we conclude that mammograms have no benefits or harm? Here are a few considerations to keep in mind when reviewing the mammogram study as well as any other medical study:   We do not reject the null hypothesis, which means we don't have sufficient evidence to conclude that mammograms reduce or increase breast cancer deaths.  If mammograms are helpful or harmful, the data suggest the effect isn't very large.  Are mammograms more or less expensive than a non-mammogram breast exam? If one option is much more expensive than the other and doesn't offer clear benefits, then we should lean towards the less expensive option.  The study's authors also found that mammograms led to overdiagnosis of breast cancer, which means some breast cancers were found (or thought to be found) but that these cancers would not cause symptoms during patients' lifetimes. That is, something else would kill the patient before breast cancer symptoms appeared. This means some patients may have been treated for breast cancer unnecessarily, and this treatment is another cost to consider. It is also important to recognize that overdiagnosis can cause unnecessary physical or emotional harm to patients.   These considerations highlight the complexity around medical care and treatment recommendations. Experts and medical boards who study medical treatments use considerations like those above to provide their best recommendation based on the current evidence.    More on 2-proportion hypothesis tests (special topic)  When we conduct a 2-proportion hypothesis test, usually is . However, there are rare situations where we want to check for some difference in and that is some value other than 0. For example, maybe we care about checking a null hypothesis where . In contexts like these, we generally use and to check the success-failure condition and construct the standard error.    A quadcopter company is considering a new manufacturer for rotor blades. The new manufacturer would be more expensive, but they claim their higher-quality blades are more reliable, with 3% more blades passing inspection than their competitor. Set up appropriate hypotheses for the test.     : The higher-quality blades will pass inspection 3% more frequently than the standard-quality blades. .   : The higher-quality blades will pass inspection some amount different than 3% more often than the standard-quality blades. .     A Phantom quadcopter. Photo by David J (http:\/\/flic.kr\/p\/oiWLNu). CC-BY 2.0 license. This photo has been cropped and a border has been added.      The quality control engineer from Guided Practice collects a sample of blades, examining 1000 blades from each company, and she finds that 899 blades pass inspection from the current supplier and 958 pass inspection from the prospective supplier. Using these data, evaluate the hypotheses from Guided Practice with a significance level of 5%.    First, we check the conditions. The sample is not necessarily random, so to proceed we must assume the blades are all independent; for this sample we will suppose this assumption is reasonable, but the engineer would be more knowledgeable as to whether this assumption is appropriate. The success-failure condition also holds for each sample. Thus, the difference in sample proportions, , can be said to come from a nearly normal distribution.  The standard error is computed using the two sample proportions since we do not use a pooled proportion for this context:   In this hypothesis test, because the null is that , the sample proportions were used for the standard error calculation rather than a pooled proportion.  Next, we compute the test statistic and use it to find the p-value, which is depicted in .   Using a standard normal distribution for this test statistic, we identify the right tail area as 0.006, and we double it to get the p-value: 0.012. We reject the null hypothesis because 0.012 is less than 0.05. Since we observed a larger-than-3% increase in blades that pass inspection, we have statistically significant evidence that the higher-quality blades pass inspection more than 3% as often as the currently used blades, exceeding the company's claims.     Distribution of the test statistic if the null hypothesis was true. The p-value is represented by the shaded areas.      Examining the standard error formula (special topic)  This subsection covers more theoretical topics that offer deeper insights into the origins of the standard error formula for the difference of two proportions. Ultimately, all of the standard error formulas we encounter in this chapter and in Chapter can be derived from the probability principles of Section .  The formula for the standard error of the difference in two proportions can be deconstructed into the formulas for the standard errors of the individual sample proportions. Recall that the standard error of the individual sample proportions and are   The standard error of the difference of two sample proportions can be deconstructed from the standard errors of the separate sample proportions:   This special relationship follows from probability theory.    Prerequisite: Section . We can rewrite the equation above in a different way:   Explain where this formula comes from using the formula for the variability of the sum of two random variables.    The standard error squared represents the variance of the estimate. If and are two random variables with variances and , then the variance of is . Likewise, the variance corresponding to is .

  "title": "Testing for goodness of fit using chi-square",
  "body": " Testing for goodness of fit using chi-square   In this section, we develop a method for assessing a null model when the data are binned. This technique is commonly used in two circumstances:   Given a sample of cases that can be classified into several groups, determine if the sample is representative of the general population.  Evaluate whether data resemble a particular distribution, such as a normal distribution or a geometric distribution.   Each of these scenarios can be addressed using the same statistical test: a chi-square test.  In the first case, we consider data from a random sample of 275 jurors in a small county. Jurors identified their racial group, as shown in , and we would like to determine if these jurors are racially representative of the population. If the jury is representative of the population, then the proportions in the sample should roughly reflect the population of eligible jurors, i.e. registered voters.   Representation by race in a city's juries and population.    Race   White  Black  Hispanic  Other   Total    Representation in juries   205  26  25  19   275    Registered voters   0.72  0.07  0.12  0.09   1.00     While the proportions in the juries do not precisely represent the population proportions, it is unclear whether these data provide convincing evidence that the sample is not representative. If the jurors really were randomly sampled from the registered voters, we might expect small differences due to chance. However, unusually large differences may provide convincing evidence that the juries were not representative.  A second application, assessing the fit of a distribution, is presented at the end of this section. Daily stock returns from the S&P500 for 25 years are used to assess whether stock activity each day is independent of the stock's behavior on previous days.  In these problems, we would like to examine all bins simultaneously, not simply compare one or two bins at a time, which will require us to develop a new test statistic.    Creating a test statistic for one-way tables    Of the people in the city, 275 served on a jury. If the individuals are randomly selected to serve on a jury, about how many of the 275 people would we expect to be White? How many would we expect to be Black?    About 72% of the population is White, so we would expect about 72% of the jurors to be White: .  Similarly, we would expect about 7% of the jurors to be Black, which would correspond to about Black jurors.      Twelve percent of the population is Hispanic and 9% represent other races. How many of the 275 jurors would we expect to be Hispanic or from another race? Answers can be found in .    Hispanic: . Other: .     Actual and expected make-up of the jurors.    Race   White  Black  Hispanic  Other   Total    Observed data   205  26  25  19   275    Expected counts   198  19.25  33  24.75   275     The sample proportion represented from each race among the 275 jurors was not a precise match for any ethnic group. While some sampling variation is expected, we would expect the sample proportions to be fairly similar to the population proportions if there is no bias on juries. We need to test whether the differences are strong enough to provide convincing evidence that the jurors are not a random sample. These ideas can be organized into hypotheses:   : The jurors are a random sample, i.e. there is no racial bias in who serves on a jury, and the observed counts reflect natural sampling fluctuation.  : The jurors are not randomly sampled, i.e. there is racial bias in juror selection.   To evaluate these hypotheses, we quantify how different the observed counts are from the expected counts. Strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis would come in the form of unusually large deviations in the groups from what would be expected based on sampling variation alone.    The chi-square test statistic  In previous hypothesis tests, we constructed a test statistic of the following form:   This construction was based on (1) identifying the difference between a point estimate and an expected value if the null hypothesis was true, and (2) standardizing that difference using the standard error of the point estimate. These two ideas will help in the construction of an appropriate test statistic for count data.  Our strategy will be to first compute the difference between the observed counts and the counts we would expect if the null hypothesis was true, then we will standardize the difference:   The standard error for the point estimate of the count in binned data is the square root of the count under the null. Using some of the rules learned in earlier chapters, we might think that the standard error would be , where is the sample size and is the proportion in the population. This would be correct if we were looking only at one count. However, we are computing many standardized differences and adding them together. It can be shown though not here that the square root of the count is a better way to standardize the count differences. Therefore:   The fraction is very similar to previous test statistics: first compute a difference, then standardize it. These computations should also be completed for the Black, Hispanic, and other groups:   We would like to use a single test statistic to determine if these four standardized differences are irregularly far from zero. That is, , , , and must be combined somehow to help determine if they as a group tend to be unusually far from zero. A first thought might be to take the absolute value of these four standardized differences and add them up:   Indeed, this does give one number summarizing how far the actual counts are from what was expected. However, it is more common to add the squared values:   Squaring each standardized difference before adding them together does two things:   Any standardized difference that is squared will now be positive.  Differences that already look unusual e.g. a standardized difference of 2.5 will become much larger after being squared.   The test statistic , which is the sum of the values, is generally used for these reasons. We can also write an equation for using the observed counts and null counts:   The final number summarizes how strongly the observed counts tend to deviate from the null counts. In Section , we will see that if the null hypothesis is true, then follows a new distribution called a chi-square distribution . Using this distribution, we will be able to obtain a p-value to evaluate the hypotheses.    The chi-square distribution and finding areas  The chi-square distribution is sometimes used to characterize data sets and statistics that are always positive and typically right skewed. Recall a normal distribution had two parameters mean and standard deviation that could be used to describe its exact characteristics. The chi-square distribution has just one parameter called degrees of freedom (df) , which influences the shape, center, and spread of the distribution.     shows three chi-square distributions.  (a) How does the center of the distribution change when the degrees of freedom is larger?  (b) What about the variability (spread)?  (c) How does the shape change?    (a) The center becomes larger. If took a careful look, we could see that the mean of each distribution is equal to the distribution's degrees of freedom.  (b) The variability increases as the degrees of freedom increases.  (c) The distribution is very strongly skewed for , and then the distributions become more symmetric for the larger degrees of freedom and . We would see this trend continue if we examined distributions with even more larger degrees of freedom.     Three chi-square distributions with varying degrees of freedom.   Three chi-square distributions are shown with degrees of freedom 2, 4, and 9 on the same plot. The horizontal axis ranges from 0 to 25 recall that the chi-square distributions never take values smaller than 0. The chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom starts at a peak at zero and then quickly declines more than halfway by the value of 2 and trails off after a value of about 5. The chi-square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom starts at 0 and quickly rises to a peak at about 2, before gradually declining and then more steeply declining starting at 3, before starting to flatten at about 5 or 6. The distribution has fallen very close to the horizontal axis by a value of 10. The chi-square distribution with 9 degrees of freedom starts at zero before gradually rising up to a peak at about 7 before declining again and trailing off between at around 15.     and Guided Practice demonstrate three general properties of chi-square distributions as the degrees of freedom increases: the distribution becomes more symmetric, the center moves to the right, and the variability inflates.  Our principal interest in the chi-square distribution is the calculation of p-values, which (as we have seen before) is related to finding the relevant area in the tail of a distribution. The most common ways to do this are using computer software, using a graphing calculator, or using a table. For folks wanting to use the table option, we provide an outline of how to read the chi-square table in Appendix C, which is also where you may find the table. For the examples below, use your preferred approach to confirm you get the same answers.     shows a chi-square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom and an upper shaded tail starting at 6.25. Find the shaded area.    Using statistical software or a graphing calculator, we can find that the upper tail area for a chi-square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom ( ) and a cutoff of 6.25 is 0.1001. That is, the shaded upper tail of has area 0.1.     Six chi-square distributions with shaded upper tails.    Chi-square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom, area above 6.25 shaded.

Find the tail area.    Using software, we can find that the tail area shaded in to be 0.1165. If using a table, we would only be able to find a range of values for the tail area: between 0.1 and 0.2.       shows an upper tail for a chi-square distribution with 5 degrees of freedom and a cutoff of 5.1. Find the tail area.    Using software, we would obtain a tail area of 0.4038.

Find the area of the upper tail.    The area is 0.1109. If using a table, we would identify that it falls between 0.1 and 0.2.       shows a cutoff of 10 on a chi-square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom. Find the area of the upper tail.    Precise value: 0.0404. If using the table: between 0.02 and 0.05.       shows a cutoff of 9.21 with a chi-square distribution with 3 df. Find the area of the upper tail.    Precise value: 0.0266. If using the table: between 0.02 and 0.05.      Finding a p-value for a chi-square distribution  In Section , we identified a new test statistic ( ) within the context of assessing whether there was evidence of racial bias in how jurors were sampled. The null hypothesis represented the claim that jurors were randomly sampled and there was no racial bias. The alternative hypothesis was that there was racial bias in how the jurors were sampled.  We determined that a large value would suggest strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis: that there was racial bias. However, we could not quantify what the chance was of observing such a large test statistic ( ) if the null hypothesis actually was true. This is where the chi-square distribution becomes useful. If the null hypothesis was true and there was no racial bias, then would follow a chi-square distribution, with three degrees of freedom in this case. Under certain conditions, the statistic follows a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom, where is the number of bins.    How many categories were there in the juror example? How many degrees of freedom should be associated with the chi-square distribution used for ?    In the jurors example, there were categories: White, Black, Hispanic, and other. According to the rule above, the test statistic should then follow a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom if is true.    Just like we checked sample size conditions to use a normal distribution in earlier sections, we must also check a sample size condition to safely apply the chi-square distribution for . Each expected count must be at least 5. In the juror example, the expected counts were 198, 19.25, 33, and 24.75, all easily above 5, so we can apply the chi-square model to the test statistic, .    If the null hypothesis is true, the test statistic would be closely associated with a chi-square distribution with three degrees of freedom. Using this distribution and test statistic, identify the p-value.    The chi-square distribution and p-value are shown in . Because larger chi-square values correspond to stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, we shade the upper tail to represent the p-value. Using statistical software (or the table in Appendix C), we can determine that the area is 0.1171. Generally we do not reject the null hypothesis with such a large p-value. In other words, the data do not provide convincing evidence of racial bias in the juror selection.     The p-value for the juror hypothesis test is shaded in the chi-square distribution with .   A chi-square distribution with 3 degrees of freedom is shown, with the area above 5.89 shaded. This region appears to be about 10% of the area under the curve.     Chi-square test for one-way table  Suppose we are to evaluate whether there is convincing evidence that a set of observed counts , , ..., in categories are unusually different from what might be expected under a null hypothesis. Call the expected counts that are based on the null hypothesis , , ..., . If each expected count is at least 5 and the null hypothesis is true, then the test statistic below follows a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom:   The p-value for this test statistic is found by looking at the upper tail of this chi-square distribution. We consider the upper tail because larger values of would provide greater evidence against the null hypothesis.    Conditions for the chi-square test  There are two conditions that must be checked before performing a chi-square test:    Independence.  Each case that contributes a count to the table must be independent of all the other cases in the table.    Sample size \/ distribution.  Each particular scenario (i.e. cell count) must have at least 5 expected cases.    Failing to check conditions may affect the test's error rates.   When examining a table with just two bins, pick a single bin and use the one-proportion methods introduced in Section .    Evaluating goodness of fit for a distribution  Section 3.5 would be useful background reading for this example, but it is not a prerequisite.  We can apply the chi-square testing framework to the second problem in this section: evaluating whether a certain statistical model fits a data set. Daily stock returns from the S&P500 for 10 years can be used to assess whether stock activity each day is independent of the stock's behavior on previous days. This sounds like a very complex question, and it is, but a chi-square test can be used to study the problem. We will label each day as Up or Down (D) depending on whether the market was up or down that day. For example, consider the following changes in price, their new labels of up and down, and then the number of days that must be observed before each Up day:   Example sequence of daily price changes and waiting times.    Change in price   2.52  -1.46  0.51  -4.07  3.36  1.10  -5.46  -1.03  -2.99  1.71    Outcome   Up  D  Up  D  Up  Up  D  D  D  Up    Days to Up   1  -  2  -  2  1  -  -  -  4     If the days really are independent, then the number of days until a positive trading day should follow a geometric distribution. The geometric distribution describes the probability of waiting for the trial to observe the first success. Here each up day (Up) represents a success, and down (D) days represent failures. In the data above, it took only one day until the market was up, so the first wait time was 1 day. It took two more days before we observed our next Up trading day, and two more for the third Up day. We would like to determine if these counts (1, 2, 2, 1, 4, and so on) follow the geometric distribution. shows the number of waiting days for a positive trading day during 10 years for the S&P500.   Observed distribution of the waiting time until a positive trading day for the S&P500.    Days   1  2  3  4  5  6  7+   Total    Observed   717  369  155  69  28  14  10   1362     We consider how many days one must wait until observing an Up day on the S&P500 stock index. If the stock activity was independent from one day to the next and the probability of a positive trading day was constant, then we would expect this waiting time to follow a geometric distribution . We can organize this into a hypothesis framework:   : The stock market being up or down on a given day is independent from all other days. We will consider the number of days that pass until an Up day is observed. Under this hypothesis, the number of days until an Up day should follow a geometric distribution.  : The stock market being up or down on a given day is not independent from all other days. Since we know the number of days until an Up day would follow a geometric distribution under the null, we look for deviations from the geometric distribution, which would support the alternative hypothesis.   There are important implications in our result for stock traders: if information from past trading days is useful in telling what will happen today, that information may provide an advantage over other traders.  We consider data for the S&P500 and summarize the waiting times in and . The S&P500 was positive on 54.5% of those days.   Distribution of the waiting time until a positive trading day. The expected counts based on the geometric model are shown in the last row. To find each expected count, we identify the probability of waiting days based on the geometric model ( ) and multiply by the total number of streaks, 1362. For example, waiting for three days occurs under the geometric model about of the time, which corresponds to streaks.    Days   1  2  3  4  5  6  7+   Total    Observed   717  369  155  69  28  14  10   1362    Geometric Model   743  338  154  70  32  14  12   1362      Side-by-side bar plot of the observed and expected counts for each waiting time.   A side-by-side bar plot is shown for the variable \"Wait Until Positive Day\", where the two groups shown for the bars are \"Observed counts\" and \"Expected counts\". The horizontal axis shows values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and \"7+\". The bar heights highest for \"1\" at roughly 715 for Observed and 740 for Expected. The bar heights for \"2\" are about half as high as at \"1\", with values of about 370 for Observed and 340 for Expected. The bar heights for \"3\" are about another half has high at about 150 for each for observed and expected. The values at 5, 6, and 7+ are all relatively small, at or below about 30.    Because applying the chi-square framework requires expected counts to be at least 5, we have binned together all the cases where the waiting time was at least 7 days to ensure each expected count is well above this minimum. The actual data, shown in the Observed row in , can be compared to the expected counts from the Geometric Model row. The method for computing expected counts is discussed in . In general, the expected counts are determined by (1) identifying the null proportion associated with each bin, then (2) multiplying each null proportion by the total count to obtain the expected counts. That is, this strategy identifies what proportion of the total count we would expect to be in each bin.    Do you notice any unusually large deviations in the graph? Can you tell if these deviations are due to chance just by looking?    It is not obvious whether differences in the observed counts and the expected counts from the geometric distribution are significantly different. That is, it is not clear whether these deviations might be due to chance or whether they are so strong that the data provide convincing evidence against the null hypothesis. However, we can perform a chi-square test using the counts in .       provides a set of count data for waiting times ( , , ...) and expected counts under the geometric distribution ( , , ...). Compute the chi-square test statistic, .           Because the expected counts are all at least 5, we can safely apply the chi-square distribution to . However, how many degrees of freedom should we use?    There are groups, so we use .

Using this information, compute a p-value.     shows the chi-square distribution, cutoff, and the shaded p-value. Using software, we can find the p-value: 0.5951. Ultimately, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the notion that the wait times follow a geometric distribution for the last 10 years of data for the S&P500, i.e. we cannot reject the notion that trading days are independent.

This region appears to be about 60% of the area under the curve.      In Example , we did not reject the null hypothesis that the trading days are independent during the last 10 years of data. Why is this so important?    It may be tempting to think the market is \"due\" for an Up day if there have been several consecutive days where it has been down. However, we haven't found strong evidence that there's any such property where the market is \"due\" for a correction. At the very least, the analysis suggests any dependence between days is very weak.     "

  "body": " Testing for independence in two-way tables   We all buy used products cars, computers, textbooks, and so on and we sometimes assume the sellers of those products will be forthright about any underlying problems with what they're selling. This is not something we should take for granted. Researchers recruited 219 participants in a study where they would sell a used iPod For readers not as old as the authors, an iPod is basically an iPhone without any cellular service, assuming it was one of the later generations. Earlier generations were more basic. that was known to have frozen twice in the past. The participants were incentivized to get as much money as they could for the iPod since they would receive a 5% cut of the sale on top of $10 for participating. The researchers wanted to understand what types of questions would elicit the seller to disclose the freezing issue.  Unbeknownst to the participants who were the sellers in the study, the buyers were collaborating with the researchers to evaluate the influence of different questions on the likelihood of getting the sellers to disclose the past issues with the iPod. The scripted buyers started with Okay, I guess I'm supposed to go first. So you've had the iPod for 2 years and ended with one of three questions:   General: What can you tell me about it?  Positive Assumption: It doesn't have any problems, does it?  Negative Assumption: What problems does it have?   The question is the treatment given to the sellers, and the response is whether the question prompted them to disclose the freezing issue with the iPod. The results are shown in , and the data suggest that asking What problems does it have? was the most effective at getting the seller to disclose the past freezing issues. However, you should also be asking yourself: could we see these results due to chance alone, or is this in fact evidence that some questions are more effective for getting at the truth?   Summary of the iPod study, where a question was posed to the study participant who acted as the seller     General  Positive Assumption  Negative Assumption  Total    Disclose Problem  2  23  36  61    Hide Problem  71  50  37  158    Total  73  73  73  219      Differences of one-way tables vs two-way tables  A one-way table describes counts for each outcome in a single variable. A two-way table describes counts for combinations of outcomes for two variables. When we consider a two-way table, we often would like to know, are these variables related in any way? That is, are they dependent (versus independent)?   The hypothesis test for the iPod experiment is really about assessing whether there is statistically significant evidence of the success each question had on getting the participant to disclose the problem with the iPod. In other words, the goal is to check whether the buyer's question was independent of whether the seller disclosed a problem.    Expected counts in two-way tables  Like with one-way tables, we will need to compute estimated counts for each cell in a two-way table.   Computing expected counts for the General group   From the experiment, we can compute the proportion of all sellers who disclosed the freezing problem as . If there really is no difference among the questions and 27.85% of sellers were going to disclose the freezing problem no matter the question that was put to them, how many of the 73 people in the General group would we have expected to disclose the freezing problem?    We would predict that sellers would disclose the problem. Obviously we observed fewer than this, though it is not yet clear if that is due to chance variation or whether that is because the questions vary in how effective they are at getting to the truth.      If the questions were actually equally effective, meaning about 27.85% of respondents would disclose the freezing issue regardless of what question they were asked, about how many sellers would we expect to hide the freezing problem from the Positive Assumption group?    We would expect . It is okay that this result, like the result from , is a fraction.    We can compute the expected number of sellers who we would expect to disclose or hide the freezing issue for all groups, if the questions had no impact on what they disclosed, using the same strategy employed in and .

For instance, if there was no difference between the groups, then about 27.85% of each column should be in the first row:   Looking back to how 0.2785 was computed as the fraction of sellers who disclosed the freezing issue ( ) these three expected counts could have been computed as   This leads us to a general formula for computing expected counts in a two-way table when we would like to test whether there is strong evidence of an association between the column variable and row variable.   Computing expected counts in a two-way table  To identify the expected count for the row and column, compute      The chi-square test for two-way tables  The chi-square test statistic for a two-way table is found the same way it is found for a one-way table. For each table count, compute   Adding the computed value for each cell gives the chi-square test statistic :   Just like before, this test statistic follows a chi-square distribution. However, the degrees of freedom are computed a little differently for a two-way table. Recall: in the one-way table, the degrees of freedom was the number of cells minus 1. For two-way tables, the degrees of freedom is equal to   In our example, the degrees of freedom parameter is   If the null hypothesis is true (i.e. the questions had no impact on the sellers in the experiment), then the test statistic closely follows a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. Using this information, we can compute the p-value for the test, which is depicted in .   Computing degrees of freedom for a two-way table  When applying the chi-square test to a two-way table, we use   where is the number of rows in the table and is the number of columns.

Using a computer, we can compute a very precise value for the tail area above for a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom: 0.000000002. (If using the table in Appendix C, we would identify the p-value is smaller than 0.001.) Using a significance level of , the null hypothesis is rejected since the p-value is smaller. That is, the data provide convincing evidence that the question asked did affect a seller's likelihood to tell the truth about problems with the iPod.     Diabetes treatment study hypotheses    summarizes the results of an experiment evaluating three treatments for Type 2 Diabetes in patients aged 10-17 who were being treated with metformin. The three treatments considered were continued treatment with metformin (met), treatment with metformin combined with rosiglitazone (rosi), or a lifestyle intervention program. Each patient had a primary outcome, which either lacked glycemic control (failure) or did not lack that control (success). What are appropriate hypotheses for this test?      : There is no difference in the effectiveness of the three treatments.  : There is some difference in effectiveness between the three treatments, e.g. perhaps the rosi treatment performed better than lifestyle.

Section Exercises   Quitters   Does being part of a support group affect the ability of people to quit smoking? A county health department enrolled 300 smokers in a randomized experiment. 150 participants were assigned to a group that used a nicotine patch and met weekly with a support group; the other 150 received the patch and did not meet with a support group. At the end of the study, 40 of the participants in the patch plus support group had quit smoking while only 30 smokers had quit in the other group.   Create a two-way table presenting the results of this study.   Answer each of the following questions under the null hypothesis that being part of a support group does not affect the ability of people to quit smoking, and indicate whether the expected values are higher or lower than the observed values.   How many subjects in the patch + support group would you expect to quit?  How many subjects in the patch only group would you expect to not quit?

However, we'll soon learn that a new distribution, called the -distribution, tends to be more useful when working with the sample mean. We'll first learn about this new distribution, then we'll use it to construct confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests for the mean.    The sampling distribution of  The sample mean tends to follow a normal distribution centered at the population mean, , when certain conditions are met. Additionally, we can compute a standard error for the sample mean using the population standard deviation and the sample size .   Central Limit Theorem for the sample mean   When we collect a sufficiently large sample of independent observations from a population with mean and standard deviation , the sampling distribution of will be nearly normal with     Before diving into confidence intervals and hypothesis tests using , we first need to cover two topics:    When we modeled using the normal distribution, certain conditions had to be satisfied. The conditions for working with are a little more complex, and we'll spend Section discussing how to check conditions for inference.    The standard error is dependent on the population standard deviation, . However, we rarely know , and instead we must estimate it. Because this estimation is itself imperfect, we use a new distribution called the -distribution to fix this problem, which we discuss in Section .      Evaluating the two conditions required for modeling  Two conditions are required to apply the Central Limit Theorem for a sample mean :    Independence.  The sample observations must be independent. The most common way to satisfy this condition is when the sample is a simple random sample from the population. If the data come from a random process, analogous to rolling a die, this would also satisfy the independence condition.    Normality.  When a sample is small, we also require that the sample observations come from a normally distributed population. We can relax this condition more and more for larger and larger sample sizes. This condition is obviously vague, making it difficult to evaluate, so next we introduce a couple rules of thumb to make checking this condition easier.     Rules of thumb: how to perform the normality check  There is no perfect way to check the normality condition, so instead we use two rules of thumb:    :  If the sample size is less than 30 and there are no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.    :  If the sample size is at least 30 and there are no particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.     In this first course in statistics, you aren't expected to develop perfect judgement on the normality condition. However, you are expected to be able to handle clear cut cases based on the rules of thumb. More nuanced guidelines would consider further relaxing the particularly extreme outlier check when the sample size is very large. However, we'll leave further discussion here to a future course.     Consider the following two plots that come from simple random samples from different populations. Their sample sizes are and .  [Figure showing two histograms: Sample 1 Observations (n=15) with values 0-7, and Sample 2 Observations (n=50) with values 0-22 with most data near zero and one outlier at 21-22]  Are the independence and normality conditions met in each case?    Each sample is from a simple random sample of its respective population, so the independence condition is satisfied. Let's next check the normality condition for each using the rule of thumb.  The first sample has fewer than 30 observations, so we are watching for any clear outliers. None are present; while there is a small gap in the histogram between 5 and 6, this gap is small and 20% of the observations in this small sample are represented in that far right bar of the histogram, so we can hardly call these clear outliers. With no clear outliers, the normality condition is reasonably met.  The second sample has a sample size greater than 30 and includes an outlier that appears to be roughly 5 times further from the center of the distribution than the next furthest observation. This is an example of a particularly extreme outlier, so the normality condition would not be satisfied.    In practice, it's typical to also do a mental check to evaluate whether we have reason to believe the underlying population would have moderate skew (if ) or have particularly extreme outliers ( ) beyond what we observe in the data. For example, consider the number of followers for each individual account on Twitter, and then imagine this distribution. The large majority of accounts have built up a couple thousand followers or fewer, while a relatively tiny fraction have amassed tens of millions of followers, meaning the distribution is extremely skewed. When we know the data come from such an extremely skewed distribution, it takes some effort to understand what sample size is large enough for the normality condition to be satisfied.    Introducing the -distribution  In practice, we cannot directly calculate the standard error for since we do not know the population standard deviation, . We encountered a similar issue when computing the standard error for a sample proportion, which relied on the population proportion, . Our solution in the proportion context was to use the sample value in place of the population value when computing the standard error. We'll employ a similar strategy for computing the standard error of , using the sample standard deviation in place of :   This strategy tends to work well when we have a lot of data and can estimate using accurately. However, the estimate is less precise with smaller samples, and this leads to problems when using the normal distribution to model .  We'll find it useful to use a new distribution for inference calculations called the -distribution . A -distribution, shown as a solid line in Figure , has a bell shape. However, its tails are thicker than the normal distribution's, meaning observations are more likely to fall beyond two standard deviations from the mean than under the normal distribution. The extra thick tails of the -distribution are exactly the correction needed to resolve the problem of using in place of in the calculation.   Comparison of a -distribution and a normal distribution.  [Figure showing a standard normal distribution and a t-distribution overlaid. The t-distribution is more sharply peaked and has thicker tails than the normal distribution.]   The -distribution is always centered at zero and has a single parameter: degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom ( ) describes the precise form of the bell-shaped -distribution. Several -distributions are shown in Figure in comparison to the normal distribution.  In general, we'll use a -distribution with to model the sample mean when the sample size is . That is, when we have more observations, the degrees of freedom will be larger and the -distribution will look more like the standard normal distribution; when the degrees of freedom is about 30 or more, the -distribution is nearly indistinguishable from the normal distribution.   The larger the degrees of freedom, the more closely the -distribution resembles the standard normal distribution.  [Figure showing four t-distributions with df=1, 2, 4, and 8 along with a normal distribution. The larger the df, the more closely the t-distribution aligns with the normal distribution.]    Degrees of freedom ( )  The degrees of freedom describes the shape of the -distribution. The larger the degrees of freedom, the more closely the distribution approximates the normal model.  When modeling using the -distribution, use .   The -distribution allows us greater flexibility than the normal distribution when analyzing numerical data. In practice, it's common to use statistical software, such as R, Python, or SAS for these analyses. Alternatively, a graphing calculator or a -table may be used; the -table is similar to the normal distribution table, and it may be found in the appendix , which includes usage instructions and examples for those who wish to use this option. No matter the approach you choose, apply your method using the examples below to confirm your working understanding of the -distribution.    What proportion of the -distribution with 18 degrees of freedom falls below ?    Just like a normal probability problem, we first draw the picture in Figure and shade the area below .

Estimate the proportion of the distribution falling more than 3 units from the mean (above or below).    With so few degrees of freedom, the -distribution will give a more notably different value than the normal distribution. Under a normal distribution, the area would be about 0.003 using the 68-95-99.7 rule. For a -distribution with , the area in both tails beyond 3 units totals 0.0955. This area is dramatically different than what we obtain from the normal distribution.      What proportion of the -distribution with 19 degrees of freedom falls above units? Use your preferred method for finding tail areas. We want to find the shaded area above  (we leave the picture to you). The lower tail area has an area of 0.0447, so the upper area would have an area of .       One sample -confidence intervals  Let's get our first taste of applying the -distribution in the context of an example about the mercury content of dolphin muscle. Elevated mercury concentrations are an important problem for both dolphins and other animals, like humans, who occasionally eat them.   A Risso's dolphin. Photo by Mike Baird (www.bairdphotos.com).

The area forward of its face is mostly white, and then its body is gray and white streaked together.]   We will identify a confidence interval for the average mercury content in dolphin muscle using a sample of 19 Risso's dolphins from the Taiji area in Japan. The data are summarized in Figure . The minimum and maximum observed values can be used to evaluate whether or not there are clear outliers.

Measurements are in micrograms of mercury per wet gram of muscle ( g\/wet g).       minimum  maximum    19  4.4  2.3  1.7  9.2       Are the independence and normality conditions satisfied for this data set?    The observations are a simple random sample, therefore independence is reasonable. The summary statistics in Figure do not suggest any clear outliers, since all observations are within 2.5 standard deviations of the mean. Based on this evidence, the normality condition seems reasonable.    In the normal model, we used and the standard error to determine the width of a confidence interval. We revise the confidence interval formula slightly when using the -distribution:     Using the summary statistics in Figure , compute the standard error for the average mercury content in the dolphins.    We plug in and into the formula: .    The value is a cutoff we obtain based on the confidence level and the -distribution with degrees of freedom. That cutoff is found in the same way as with a normal distribution: we find such that the fraction of the -distribution with degrees of freedom within a distance of 0 matches the confidence level of interest.    When , what is the appropriate degrees of freedom? Find for this degrees of freedom and the confidence level of 95%.    The degrees of freedom is easy to calculate: .  Using statistical software, we find the cutoff where the upper tail is equal to 2.5%: . The area below will also be equal to 2.5%. That is, 95% of the -distribution with lies within 2.10 units of 0.      Compute and interpret the 95% confidence interval for the average mercury content in Risso's dolphins.    We can construct the confidence interval as   We are 95% confident the average mercury content of muscles in Risso's dolphins is between 3.29 and 5.51 g\/wet gram, which is considered extremely high.     Finding a -confidence interval for the mean  Based on a sample of independent and nearly normal observations, a confidence interval for the population mean is   where is the sample mean, corresponds to the confidence level and degrees of freedom , and is the standard error as estimated by the sample.     The FDA's webpage provides some data on mercury content of fish. Based on a sample of 15 croaker white fish (Pacific), a sample mean and standard deviation were computed as 0.287 and 0.069 ppm (parts per million), respectively. The 15 observations ranged from 0.18 to 0.41 ppm. We will assume these observations are independent. Based on the summary statistics of the data, do you have any objections to the normality condition of the individual observations? The sample size is under 30, so we check for obvious outliers: since all observations are within 2 standard deviations of the mean, there are no such clear outliers.       Estimate the standard error of ppm using the data summaries in Guided Practice . If we are to use the -distribution to create a 90% confidence interval for the actual mean of the mercury content, identify the degrees of freedom and .    The standard error: .  Degrees of freedom: .  Since the goal is a 90% confidence interval, we choose so that the two-tail area is 0.1: .     Confidence interval for a single mean  Once you've determined a one-mean confidence interval would be helpful for an application, there are four steps to constructing the interval:    Prepare.  Identify , , , and determine what confidence level you wish to use.    Check.  Verify the conditions to ensure is nearly normal.    Calculate.  If the conditions hold, compute , find , and construct the interval.    Conclude.  Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the problem.       Using the information and results of Guided Practice and Example , compute a 90% confidence interval for the average mercury content of croaker white fish (Pacific). . We are 90% confident that the average mercury content of croaker white fish (Pacific) is between 0.256 and 0.318 ppm.       The 90% confidence interval from Guided Practice is 0.256 ppm to 0.318 ppm. Can we say that 90% of croaker white fish (Pacific) have mercury levels between 0.256 and 0.318 ppm? No, a confidence interval only provides a range of plausible values for a population parameter, in this case the population mean. It does not describe what we might observe for individual observations.       One sample -tests  Is the typical US runner getting faster or slower over time? We consider this question in the context of the Cherry Blossom Race, which is a 10-mile race in Washington, DC each spring.  The average time for all runners who finished the Cherry Blossom Race in 2006 was 93.29 minutes (93 minutes and about 17 seconds). We want to determine using data from 100 participants in the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race whether runners in this race are getting faster or slower, versus the other possibility that there has been no change.    What are appropriate hypotheses for this context? : The average 10-mile run time was the same for 2006 and 2017. minutes. : The average 10-mile run time for 2017 was different than that of 2006. minutes.       The data come from a simple random sample of all participants, so the observations are independent. However, should we be worried about the normality condition? See Figure for a histogram of the differences and evaluate if we can move forward. With a sample of 100, we should only be concerned if there are particularly extreme outliers. The histogram of the data doesn't show any outliers of concern (and arguably, no outliers at all).      A histogram of time for the sample Cherry Blossom Race data.  [Figure showing a histogram of \"time\" for the sample. The data are nearly symmetric with a center at about 100 minutes and a standard deviation of roughly 15 to 20 minutes. All times lie between 50 and 140 minutes.]   When completing a hypothesis test for the one-sample mean, the process is nearly identical to completing a hypothesis test for a single proportion. First, we find the Z-score using the observed value, null value, and standard error; however, we call it a T-score since we use a -distribution for calculating the tail area. Then we find the p-value using the same ideas we used previously: find the one-tail area under the sampling distribution, and double it.    With both the independence and normality conditions satisfied, we can proceed with a hypothesis test using the -distribution. The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the sample of 100 runners from the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race are 97.32 and 16.98 minutes, respectively. Recall that the sample size is 100 and the average run time in 2006 was 93.29 minutes. Find the test statistic and p-value. What is your conclusion?    To find the test statistic (T-score), we first must determine the standard error:   Now we can compute the T-score using the sample mean (97.32), null value (93.29), and :   For , we can determine using statistical software (or a -table) that the one-tail area is 0.01, which we double to get the p-value: 0.02.  Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data provide strong evidence that the average run time for the Cherry Blossom Run in 2017 is different than the 2006 average. Since the observed value is above the null value and we have rejected the null hypothesis, we would conclude that runners in the race were slower on average in 2017 than in 2006.     Hypothesis testing for a single mean  Once you've determined a one-mean hypothesis test is the correct procedure, there are four steps to completing the test:    Prepare.  Identify the parameter of interest, list out hypotheses, identify the significance level, and identify , , and .    Check.  Verify conditions to ensure is nearly normal.    Calculate.  If the conditions hold, compute , compute the T-score, and identify the p-value.    Conclude.  Evaluate the hypothesis test by comparing the p-value to , and provide a conclusion in the context of the problem.

This confidence interval is based on a simple random sample of 36 observations. Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation. Assume that all conditions necessary for inference are satisfied. Use the -distribution in any calculations.     Working backwards, Part II   A 90% confidence interval for a population mean is (65, 77). The population distribution is approximately normal and the population standard deviation is unknown. This confidence interval is based on a simple random sample of 25 observations. Calculate the sample mean, the margin of error, and the sample standard deviation.     Sleep habits of New Yorkers   New York is known as \"the city that never sleeps\". A random sample of 25 New Yorkers were asked how much sleep they get per night. Statistical summaries of these data are shown below. The point estimate suggests New Yorkers sleep less than 8 hours a night on average. Is the result statistically significant?    n   s  min  max    25  7.73  0.77  6.17  9.78     Write the hypotheses in symbols and in words.

What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test?  If you were to construct a 90% confidence interval that corresponded to this hypothesis test, would you expect 8 hours to be in the interval?      Heights of adults   Researchers studying anthropometry collected body girth measurements and skeletal diameter measurements, as well as age, weight, height and gender, for 507 physically active individuals. The histogram below shows the sample distribution of heights in centimeters.     Summary statistics:    Min 147.2  Q1 163.8  Median 170.3  Mean 171.1  SD 9.4  Q3 177.8  Max 198.1    What is the point estimate for the average height of active individuals? What about the median?  What is the point estimate for the standard deviation of the heights of active individuals? What about the IQR?  Is a person who is 1m 80cm (180 cm) tall considered unusually tall? And is a person who is 1m 55cm (155cm) considered unusually short? Explain your reasoning.  The researchers take another random sample of physically active individuals. Would you expect the mean and the standard deviation of this new sample to be the ones given above? Explain your reasoning.  The sample means obtained are point estimates for the mean height of all active individuals, if the sample of individuals is equivalent to a simple random sample. What measure do we use to quantify the variability of such an estimate? Compute this quantity using the data from the original sample under the condition that the data are a simple random sample.      Find the mean   You are given the following hypotheses:   We know that the sample standard deviation is 8 and the sample size is 20. For what sample mean would the p-value be equal to 0.05? Assume that all conditions necessary for inference are satisfied.     vs.   For a given confidence level, is larger than . Explain how being slightly larger than affects the width of the confidence interval.     Play the piano   Georgianna claims that in a small city renowned for its music school, the average child takes less than 5 years of piano lessons. We have a random sample of 20 children from the city, with a mean of 4.6 years of piano lessons and a standard deviation of 2.2 years.   Evaluate Georgianna's claim (or that the opposite might be true) using a hypothesis test.  Construct a 95% confidence interval for the number of years students in this city take piano lessons, and interpret it in context of the data.  Do your results from the hypothesis test and the confidence interval agree? Explain your reasoning.      Auto exhaust and lead exposure   Researchers interested in lead exposure due to car exhaust sampled the blood of 52 police officers subjected to constant inhalation of automobile exhaust fumes while working traffic enforcement in a primarily urban environment. The blood samples of these officers had an average lead concentration of 124.32 g\/l and a SD of 37.74 g\/l; a previous study of individuals from a nearby suburb, with no history of exposure, found an average blood level concentration of 35 g\/l.   Write down the hypotheses that would be appropriate for testing if the police officers appear to have been exposed to a different concentration of lead.  Explicitly state and check all conditions necessary for inference on these data.  Regardless of your answers in part (b), test the hypothesis that the downtown police officers have a higher lead exposure than the group in the previous study. Interpret your results in context.      Car insurance savings   A market researcher wants to evaluate car insurance savings at a competing company. Based on past studies he is assuming that the standard deviation of savings is $100. He wants to collect data such that he can get a margin of error of no more than $10 at a 95% confidence level. How large of a sample should he collect?     SAT scores   The standard deviation of SAT scores for students at a particular Ivy League college is 250 points. Two statistics students, Raina and Luke, want to estimate the average SAT score of students at this college as part of a class project. They want their margin of error to be no more than 25 points.   Raina wants to use a 90% confidence interval. How large a sample should she collect?  Luke wants to use a 99% confidence interval. Without calculating the actual sample size, determine whether his sample should be larger or smaller than Raina's, and explain your reasoning.  Calculate the minimum required sample size for Luke.      "

Each sample is from a simple random sample of its respective population, so the independence condition is satisfied. Let's next check the normality condition for each using the rule of thumb.  The first sample has fewer than 30 observations, so we are watching for any clear outliers. None are present; while there is a small gap in the histogram between 5 and 6, this gap is small and 20% of the observations in this small sample are represented in that far right bar of the histogram, so we can hardly call these clear outliers. With no clear outliers, the normality condition is reasonably met.  The second sample has a sample size greater than 30 and includes an outlier that appears to be roughly 5 times further from the center of the distribution than the next furthest observation. This is an example of a particularly extreme outlier, so the normality condition would not be satisfied.   "

Of those, 68 required books could be found on Amazon. A portion of the data set from these courses is shown in Figure , where prices are in US dollars.

When two sets of observations have this special correspondence, they are said to be paired .   Paired data  Two sets of observations are paired if each observation in one set has a special correspondence or connection with exactly one observation in the other data set.   To analyze paired data, it is often useful to look at the difference in outcomes of each pair of observations. In the textbook data, we look at the differences in prices, which is represented as the price_difference variable in the data set. Here the differences are taken as   It is important that we always subtract using a consistent order; here Amazon prices are always subtracted from UCLA prices. The first difference shown in Figure is computed as . Similarly, the second difference is computed as , and the third is . A histogram of the differences is shown in Figure . Using differences between paired observations is a common and useful way to analyze paired data.   Histogram of the difference in price for each book sampled.        Inference for paired data  To analyze a paired data set, we simply analyze the differences. We can use the same -distribution techniques we applied in Section .   Summary statistics for the 68 price differences.           68   3.58   13.42       Set up a hypothesis test to determine whether, on average, there is a difference between Amazon's price for a book and the UCLA bookstore's price. Also, check the conditions for whether we can move forward with the test using the -distribution.    We are considering two scenarios: there is no difference or there is some difference in average prices.   : . There is no difference in the average textbook price.  : . There is a difference in average prices.   Next, we check the independence and normality conditions. The observations are based on a simple random sample, so independence is reasonable. While there are some outliers, and none of the outliers are particularly extreme, so the normality of is satisfied. With these conditions satisfied, we can move forward with the -distribution.      Complete the hypothesis test started in Example .    To compute the test statistic, we compute the standard error associated with using the standard deviation of the differences ( ) and the number of differences ( ):   The test statistic is the T-score of under the null condition that the actual mean difference is 0:   To visualize the p-value, the sampling distribution of is drawn as though is true, and the p-value is represented by the two shaded tails:     The degrees of freedom is . Using statistical software, we find the one-tail area of 0.0156. Doubling this area gives the p-value: 0.0312.  Because the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. Amazon prices are, on average, lower than the UCLA Bookstore prices for UCLA courses.      Create a 95% confidence interval for the average price difference between books at the UCLA bookstore and books on Amazon. Conditions have already been verified and the standard error computed in Example . To find the interval, identify using statistical software or the -table ( ), and plug it, the point estimate, and the standard error into the confidence interval formula: . We are 95% confident that Amazon is, on average, between $0.32 and $6.84 less expensive than the UCLA Bookstore for UCLA course books.       We have strong evidence that Amazon is, on average, less expensive. How should this conclusion affect UCLA student buying habits? Should UCLA students always buy their books on Amazon? The average price difference is only mildly useful for this question. Examine the distribution shown in Figure . There are certainly a handful of cases where Amazon prices are far below the UCLA Bookstore's, which suggests it is worth checking Amazon (and probably other online sites) before purchasing. However, in many cases the Amazon price is above what the UCLA Bookstore charges, and most of the time the price isn't that different. Ultimately, if getting a book immediately from the bookstore is notably more convenient, e.g. to get started on reading or homework, it's likely a good idea to go with the UCLA Bookstore unless the price difference on a specific book happens to be quite large. For reference, this is a very different result from what we (the authors) had seen in a similar data set from 2010. At that time, Amazon prices were almost uniformly lower than those of the UCLA Bookstore's and by a large margin, making the case to use Amazon over the UCLA Bookstore quite compelling at that time. Now we frequently check multiple websites to find the best price.       Section Exercises   Air quality   Air quality measurements were collected in a random sample of 25 country capitals in 2013, and then again in the same cities in 2014. We would like to use these data to compare average air quality between the two years. Should we use a paired or non-paired test? Explain your reasoning.     True \/ False: paired   Determine if the following statements are true or false. If false, explain.   In a paired analysis we first take the difference of each pair of observations, and then we do inference on these differences.  Two data sets of different sizes cannot be analyzed as paired data.  Consider two sets of data that are paired with each other. Each observation in one data set has a natural correspondence with exactly one observation from the other data set.  Consider two sets of data that are paired with each other. Each observation in one data set is subtracted from the average of the other data set's observations.      Paired or not?

We would like to know if Intel's stock and Southwest Airlines' stock have similar rates of return. To find out, we take a random sample of 50 days, and record Intel's and Southwest's stock on those same days.  We randomly sample 50 items from Target stores and note the price for each. Then we visit Walmart and collect the price for each of those same 50 items.  A school board would like to determine whether there is a difference in average SAT scores for students at one high school versus another high school in the district. To check, they take a simple random sample of 100 students from each high school.      Global warming, Part I   Let's consider a limited set of climate data, examining temperature differences in 1948 vs 2018. We sampled 197 locations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) historical data, where the data was available for both years of interest. We want to know: were there more days with temperatures exceeding 90°F in 2018 or in 1948? The difference in number of days exceeding 90°F (number of days in 2018 - number of days in 1948) was calculated for each of the 197 locations. The average of these differences was 2.9 days with a standard deviation of 17.2 days. We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong evidence that there were more days in 2018 that exceeded 90°F from NOAA's weather stations.      Is there a relationship between the observations collected in 1948 and 2018? Or are the observations in the two groups independent? Explain.  Write hypotheses for this research in symbols and in words.  Check the conditions required to complete this test. A histogram of the differences is given to the right.  Calculate the test statistic and find the p-value.  Use to evaluate the test, and interpret your conclusion in context.  What type of error might we have made? Explain in context what the error means.  Based on the results of this hypothesis test, would you expect a confidence interval for the average difference between the number of days exceeding 90°F from 1948 and 2018 to include 0? Explain your reasoning.      High School and Beyond, Part I   The National Center of Education Statistics conducted a survey of high school seniors, collecting test data on reading, writing, and several other subjects. Here we examine a simple random sample of 200 students from this survey. Side-by-side box plots of reading and writing scores as well as a histogram of the differences in scores are shown below.         Is there a clear difference in the average reading and writing scores?  Are the reading and writing scores of each student independent of each other?  Create hypotheses appropriate for the following research question: is there an evident difference in the average scores of students in the reading and writing exam?  Check the conditions required to complete this test.  The average observed difference in scores is , and the standard deviation of the differences is 8.887 points. Do these data provide convincing evidence of a difference between the average scores on the two exams?  What type of error might we have made? Explain what the error means in the context of the application.  Based on the results of this hypothesis test, would you expect a confidence interval for the average difference between the reading and writing scores to include 0? Explain your reasoning.      Global warming, Part II   We considered the change in the number of days exceeding 90°F from 1948 and 2018 at 197 randomly sampled locations from the NOAA database in Exercise . The mean and standard deviation of the reported differences are 2.9 days and 17.2 days.   Calculate a 90% confidence interval for the average difference between number of days exceeding 90°F between 1948 and 2018. We've already checked the conditions for you.  Interpret the interval in context.  Does the confidence interval provide convincing evidence that there were more days exceeding 90°F in 2018 than in 1948 at NOAA stations? Explain.      High school and beyond, Part II   We considered the differences between the reading and writing scores of a random sample of 200 students who took the High School and Beyond Survey in Exercise . The mean and standard deviation of the differences are and 8.887 points.   Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average difference between the reading and writing scores of all students.  Interpret this interval in context.  Does the confidence interval provide convincing evidence that there is a real difference in the average scores? Explain.      "

The average price difference is only mildly useful for this question. Examine the distribution shown in Figure . There are certainly a handful of cases where Amazon prices are far below the UCLA Bookstore's, which suggests it is worth checking Amazon (and probably other online sites) before purchasing. However, in many cases the Amazon price is above what the UCLA Bookstore charges, and most of the time the price isn't that different. Ultimately, if getting a book immediately from the bookstore is notably more convenient, e.g. to get started on reading or homework, it's likely a good idea to go with the UCLA Bookstore unless the price difference on a specific book happens to be quite large. For reference, this is a very different result from what we (the authors) had seen in a similar data set from 2010. At that time, Amazon prices were almost uniformly lower than those of the UCLA Bookstore's and by a large margin, making the case to use Amazon over the UCLA Bookstore quite compelling at that time. Now we frequently check multiple websites to find the best price.    "

  "body": " Difference of two means   In this section we consider a difference in two population means, , under the condition that the data are not paired. Just as with a single sample, we identify conditions to ensure we can use the -distribution with a point estimate of the difference, , and a new standard error formula. Other than these two differences, the details are almost identical to the one-mean procedures.  We apply these methods in three contexts: determining whether stem cells can improve heart function, exploring the relationship between pregnant womens' smoking habits and birth weights of newborns, and exploring whether there is statistically significant evidence that one variation of an exam is harder than another variation. This section is motivated by questions like Is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who don't smoke?     Confidence interval for a difference of means  Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart attack? Figure contains summary statistics for an experiment to test ESCs in sheep that had a heart attack. Each of these sheep was randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts' pumping capacity was measured in the study. Figure provides histograms of the two data sets. A positive value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which generally suggests a stronger recovery. Our goal will be to identify a 95% confidence interval for the effect of ESCs on the change in heart pumping capacity relative to the control group.   Summary statistics of the embryonic stem cell study.          ESCs  9  3.50  5.17    control  9   2.76     The point estimate of the difference in the heart pumping variable is straightforward to find: it is the difference in the sample means.   For the question of whether we can model this difference using a -distribution, we'll need to check new conditions. Like the 2-proportion cases, we will require a more robust version of independence so we are confident the two groups are also independent. Secondly, we also check for normality in each group separately, which in practice is a check for outliers.   Using the -distribution for a difference in means  The -distribution can be used for inference when working with the standardized difference of two means if     Independence, extended. The data are independent within and between the two groups, e.g. the data come from independent random samples or from a randomized experiment.     Normality. We check the outliers rules of thumb for each group separately.    The standard error may be computed as   The official formula for the degrees of freedom is quite complex and is generally computed using software, so instead you may use the smaller of and for the degrees of freedom if software isn't readily available.     Can the -distribution be used to make inference using the point estimate, ?    First, we check for independence. Because the sheep were randomized into the groups, independence within and between groups is satisfied.  Figure does not reveal any clear outliers in either group. (The ESC group does look a bit more variability, but this is not the same as having clear outliers.)  With both conditions met, we can use the -distribution to model the difference of sample means.     Histograms for both the embryonic stem cell and control group.      As with the one-sample case, we always compute the standard error using sample standard deviations rather than population standard deviations:   Generally, we use statistical software to find the appropriate degrees of freedom, or if software isn't available, we can use the smaller of and for the degrees of freedom, e.g. if using a -table to find tail areas. For transparency in the Examples and Guided Practice, we'll use the latter approach for finding ; in the case of the ESC example, this means we'll use .    Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the effect of ESCs on the change in heart pumping capacity of sheep after they've suffered a heart attack.    We will use the sample difference and the standard error that we computed earlier calculations:   Using , we can identify the critical value of for a 95% confidence interval. Finally, we can enter the values into the confidence interval formula:   We are 95% confident that embryonic stem cells improve the heart's pumping function in sheep that have suffered a heart attack by 3.32% to 12.34%.    As with past statistical inference applications, there is a well-trodden procedure.    Prepare.  Retrieve critical contextual information, and if appropriate, set up hypotheses.    Check.  Ensure the required conditions are reasonably satisfied.    Calculate.  Find the standard error, and then construct a confidence interval, or if conducting a hypothesis test, find a test statistic and p-value.    Conclude.  Interpret the results in the context of the application.    The details change a little from one setting to the next, but this general approach remain the same.    Hypothesis tests for the difference of two means  A data set called ncbirths represents a random sample of 150 cases of mothers and their newborns in North Carolina over a year. Four cases from this data set are represented in Figure . We are particularly interested in two variables: weight and smoke . The weight variable represents the weights of the newborns and the smoke variable describes which mothers smoked during pregnancy. We would like to know, is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who don't smoke? We will use the North Carolina sample to try to answer this question. The smoking group includes 50 cases and the nonsmoking group contains 100 cases.   Four cases from the ncbirths data set. The value NA , shown for the first two entries of the first variable, indicates that piece of data is missing.     fage  mage  weeks  weight  sex  smoke    1  NA  13  37  5.00  female  nonsmoker    2  NA  14  36  5.88  female  nonsmoker    3  19  15  41  8.13  male  smoker             150  45  50  36  9.25  female  nonsmoker       Set up appropriate hypotheses to evaluate whether there is a relationship between a mother smoking and average birth weight.    The null hypothesis represents the case of no difference between the groups.     : There is no difference in average birth weight for newborns from mothers who did and did not smoke. In statistical notation: , where represents non-smoking mothers and represents mothers who smoked.     : There is some difference in average newborn weights from mothers who did and did not smoke ( ).      We check the two conditions necessary to model the difference in sample means using the -distribution.    Because the data come from a simple random sample, the observations are independent, both within and between samples.    With both data sets over 30 observations, we inspect the data in Figure for any particularly extreme outliers and find none.    Since both conditions are satisfied, the difference in sample means may be modeled using a -distribution.   The left panel represents birth weights for infants whose mothers smoked. The right panel represents the birth weights for infants whose mothers who did not smoke.        The summary statistics in Figure may be useful for this Guided Practice.    What is the point estimate of the population difference, ?    Compute the standard error of the point estimate from part (a).      (a) The difference in sample means is an appropriate point estimate: .  (b) The standard error of the estimate can be calculated using the standard error formula:      Summary statistics for the ncbirths data set.     smoker  nonsmoker    mean  6.78  7.18    st. dev.  1.43  1.60    samp. size  50  100       Complete the hypothesis test started in Example and Guided Practice . Use a significance level of . For reference, , , and the sample sizes were and .    We can find the test statistic for this test using the values from Guided Practice :   The p-value is represented by the two shaded tails in the following plot:   Distribution of the difference of sample means for the baby smoke data.      We find the single tail area using software (or the -table in the appendix). We'll use the smaller of and as the degrees of freedom: . The one tail area is 0.065; doubling this value gives the two-tail area and p-value, 0.135.  The p-value is larger than the significance value, 0.05, so we do not reject the null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to say there is a difference in average birth weight of newborns from North Carolina mothers who did smoke during pregnancy and newborns from North Carolina mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy.      We've seen much research suggesting smoking is harmful during pregnancy, so how could we fail to reject the null hypothesis in Example ?    It is possible that there is a difference but we did not detect it. If there is a difference, we made a Type 2 Error.      If we made a Type 2 Error and there is a difference, what could we have done differently in data collection to be more likely to detect the difference?    We could have collected more data. If the sample sizes are larger, we tend to have a better shot at finding a difference if one exists. In fact, this is exactly what we would find if we examined a larger data set!    Public service announcement: while we have used this relatively small data set as an example, larger data sets show that women who smoke tend to have smaller newborns. In fact, some in the tobacco industry actually had the audacity to tout that as a benefit of smoking:    It's true. The babies born from women who smoke are smaller, but they're just as healthy as the babies born from women who do not smoke. And some women would prefer having smaller babies.   - Joseph Cullman, Philip Morris' Chairman of the Board on CBS' Face the Nation , Jan 3, 1971   Fact check: the babies from women who smoke are not actually as healthy as the babies from women who do not smoke.

Please be aware that there is some adult language: youtu.be\/6UsHHOCH4q8 .     Case study: two versions of a course exam  An instructor decided to run two slight variations of the same exam. Prior to passing out the exams, she shuffled the exams together to ensure each student received a random version. Summary statistics for how students performed on these two exams are shown in Figure . Anticipating complaints from students who took Version B, she would like to evaluate whether the difference observed in the groups is so large that it provides convincing evidence that Version B was more difficult (on average) than Version A.

We will later evaluate these hypotheses using .     : the exams are equally difficult, on average. . : one exam was more difficult than the other, on average. .      To evaluate the hypotheses in Guided Practice using the -distribution, we must first verify conditions.    Does it seem reasonable that the scores are independent?    Any concerns about outliers?      (a) Since the exams were shuffled, the treatment in this case was randomly assigned, so independence within and between groups is satisfied.  (b) The summary statistics suggest the data are roughly symmetric about the mean, and the min\/max values don't suggest any outliers of concern.    After verifying the conditions for each sample and confirming the samples are independent of each other, we are ready to conduct the test using the -distribution. In this case, we are estimating the true difference in average test scores using the sample data, so the point estimate is . The standard error of the estimate can be calculated as   Finally, we construct the test statistic:   If we have a computer handy, we can identify the degrees of freedom as 45.97. Otherwise we use the smaller of and : .   The -distribution with 26 degrees of freedom and the p-value from exam example represented as the shaded areas.        Identify the p-value depicted in Figure using , and provide a conclusion in the context of the case study.    Using software, we can find the one-tail area (0.13) and then double this value to get the two-tail area, which is the p-value: 0.26. (Alternatively, we could use the -table in the appendix.)  In Guided Practice , we specified that we would use . Since the p-value is larger than , we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data do not convincingly show that one exam version is more difficult than the other, and the teacher should not be convinced that she should add points to the Version B exam scores.      Pooled standard deviation estimate (special topic)  Occasionally, two populations will have standard deviations that are so similar that they can be treated as identical. For example, historical data or a well-understood biological mechanism may justify this strong assumption. In such cases, we can make the -distribution approach slightly more precise by using a pooled standard deviation.  The pooled standard deviation of two groups is a way to use data from both samples to better estimate the standard deviation and standard error. If and are the standard deviations of groups 1 and 2 and there are very good reasons to believe that the population standard deviations are equal, then we can obtain an improved estimate of the group variances by pooling their data:   where and are the sample sizes, as before. To use this new statistic, we substitute in place of and in the standard error formula, and we use an updated formula for the degrees of freedom:   The benefits of pooling the standard deviation are realized through obtaining a better estimate of the standard deviation for each group and using a larger degrees of freedom parameter for the -distribution. Both of these changes may permit a more accurate model of the sampling distribution of , if the standard deviations of the two groups are indeed equal.   Pool standard deviations only after careful consideration  A pooled standard deviation is only appropriate when background research indicates the population standard deviations are nearly equal. When the sample size is large and the condition may be adequately checked with data, the benefits of pooling the standard deviations greatly diminishes.

Diamonds, Part I   Prices of diamonds are determined by what is known as the 4 Cs: cut, clarity, color, and carat weight. The prices of diamonds go up as the carat weight increases, but the increase is not smooth. For example, the difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye, but the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 diamond. In this question we use two random samples of diamonds, 0.99 carats and 1 carat, each sample of size 23, and compare the average prices of the diamonds. In order to be able to compare equivalent units, we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats. That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond, we divide the price by 99. For a 1 carat diamond, we divide the price by 100. The distributions and some sample statistics are shown below.  Conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate if there is a difference between the average standardized prices of 0.99 and 1 carat diamonds. Make sure to state your hypotheses clearly, check relevant conditions, and interpret your results in context of the data.     0.99 carats  1 carat    Mean  $44.51  $56.81    SD  $13.32  $16.13    n  23  23         Friday the 13 , Part II   The Friday the study reported in Exercise also provides data on traffic accident related emergency room admissions.

  "title": "Power calculations for a difference of means",
  "body": " Power calculations for a difference of means   Often times in experiment planning, there are two competing considerations:   We want to collect enough data that we can detect important effects.    Collecting data can be expensive, and in experiments involving people, there may be some risk to patients.   In this section, we focus on the context of a clinical trial, which is a health-related experiment where the subject are people, and we will determine an appropriate sample size where we can be 80% sure that we would detect any practically important effects. Even though we don't cover it explicitly, similar sample size planning is also helpful for observational studies.     Going through the motions of a test  We're going to go through the motions of a hypothesis test. This will help us frame our calculations for determining an appropriate sample size for the study.    Suppose a pharmaceutical company has developed a new drug for lowering blood pressure, and they are preparing a clinical trial (experiment) to test the drug's effectiveness. They recruit people who are taking a particular standard blood pressure medication. People in the control group will continue to take their current medication through generic-looking pills to ensure blinding. Write down the hypotheses for a two-sided hypothesis test in this context.    Generally, clinical trials use a two-sided alternative hypothesis, so below are suitable hypotheses for this context:   :  The new drug performs exactly as well as the standard medication. .    :  The new drug's performance differs from the standard medication. .         The researchers would like to run the clinical trial on patients with systolic blood pressures between 140 and 180 mmHg. Suppose previously published studies suggest that the standard deviation of the patients' blood pressures will be about 12 mmHg and the distribution of patient blood pressures will be approximately symmetric. In this particular study, we'd generally measure each patient's blood pressure at the beginning and end of the study, and then the outcome measurement for the study would be the average change in blood pressure. That is, both and would represent average differences. This is what you might think of as a 2-sample paired testing structure, and we'd analyze it exactly just like a hypothesis test for a difference in the average change for patients. In the calculations we perform here, we'll suppose that 12 mmHg is the predicted standard deviation of a patient's blood pressure difference over the course of the study. If we had 100 patients per group, what would be the approximate standard error for ?    The standard error is calculated as follows: This may be an imperfect estimate of , since the standard deviation estimate we used may not be perfectly correct for this group of patients. However, it is sufficient for our purposes.      What does the null distribution of look like?    The degrees of freedom are greater than 30, so the distribution of will be approximately normal. The standard deviation of this distribution (the standard error) would be about 1.70, and under the null hypothesis, its mean would be 0.       For what values of would we reject the null hypothesis?    For , we would reject if the difference is in the lower 2.5% or upper 2.5% tail:   Lower 2.5%:  For the normal model, this is 1.96 standard errors below 0, so any difference smaller than mmHg.    Upper 2.5%:  For the normal model, this is 1.96 standard errors above 0, so any difference larger than mmHg.   The boundaries of these rejection regions are shown below:     Next, we'll perform some hypothetical calculations to determine the probability we reject the null hypothesis, if the alternative hypothesis were actually true.    Computing the power for a 2-sample test  When planning a study, we want to know how likely we are to detect an effect we care about. In other words, if there is a real effect, and that effect is large enough that it has practical value, then what's the probability that we detect that effect? This probability is called the power , and we can compute it for different sample sizes or for different effect sizes .  We first determine what is a practically significant result. Suppose that the company researchers care about finding any effect on blood pressure that is 3 mmHg or larger vs the standard medication. Here, 3 mmHg is the minimum effect size of interest, and we want to know how likely we are to detect this size of an effect in the study.    Suppose we decided to move forward with 100 patients per treatment group and the new drug reduces blood pressure by an additional 3 mmHg relative to the standard medication. What is the probability that we detect a drop?    Before we even do any calculations, notice that if mmHg, there wouldn't even be sufficient evidence to reject . That's not a good sign.  To calculate the probability that we will reject , we need to determine a few things:   The sampling distribution for when the true difference is -3 mmHg. This is the same as the null distribution, except it is shifted to the left by 3:     The rejection regions, which are outside of the dotted lines above.    The fraction of the distribution that falls in the rejection region.   In short, we need to calculate the probability that for a normal distribution with mean -3 and standard deviation 1.7. To do so, we first shade the area we want to calculate:   We'll use a normal approximation, which is good approximation when the degrees of freedom is about 30 or more. We'll start by calculating the Z-score and find the tail area using either statistical software or the probability table: The power for the test is about 42% when and each group has a sample size of 100.    In Example , we ignored the upper rejection region in the calculation, which was in the opposite direction of the hypothetical truth, i.e. -3. The reasoning? There wouldn't be any value in rejecting the null hypothesis and concluding there was an increase when in fact there was a decrease.  We've also used a normal distribution instead of the -distribution. This is a convenience, and if the sample size is too small, we'd need to revert back to using the -distribution. We'll discuss this a bit further at the end of this section.    Determining a proper sample size  In the last example, we found that if we have a sample size of 100 in each group, we can only detect an effect size of 3 mmHg with a probability of about 0.42. Suppose the researchers moved forward and only used 100 patients per group, and the data did not support the alternative hypothesis, i.e. the researchers did not reject . This is a very bad situation to be in for a few reasons:   In the back of the researchers' minds, they'd all be wondering, maybe there is a real and meaningful difference, but we weren't able to detect it with such a small sample .    The company probably invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the new drug, so now they are left with great uncertainty about its potential since the experiment didn't have a great shot at detecting effects that could still be important.    Patients were subjected to the drug, and we can't even say with much certainty that the drug doesn't help (or harm) patients.    Another clinical trial may need to be run to get a more conclusive answer as to whether the drug does hold any practical value, and conducting a second clinical trial may take years and many millions of dollars.   We want to avoid this situation, so we need to determine an appropriate sample size to ensure we can be pretty confident that we'll detect any effects that are practically important. As mentioned earlier, a change of 3 mmHg was deemed to be the minimum difference that was practically important. As a first step, we could calculate power for several different sample sizes. For instance, let's try 500 patients per group.    Calculate the power to detect a change of -3 mmHg when using a sample size of 500 per group.   Determine the standard error (recall that the standard deviation for patients was expected to be about 12 mmHg).    Identify the null distribution and rejection regions.    Identify the alternative distribution when .    Compute the probability we reject the null hypothesis.       (a) The standard error is given as .  (b) & (c) The null distribution, rejection boundaries, and alternative distribution are shown below:   The rejection regions are the areas on the outside of the two dotted lines and are at .  (d) The area of the alternative distribution where has been shaded. We compute the Z-score and find the tail area: . With 500 patients per group, we would be about 97.7% sure (or more) that we'd detect any effects that are at least 3 mmHg in size.    The researchers decided 3 mmHg was the minimum difference that was practically important, and with a sample size of 500, we can be very certain (97.7% or better) that we will detect any such difference. We now have moved to another extreme where we are exposing an unnecessary number of patients to the new drug in the clinical trial. Not only is this ethically questionable, but it would also cost a lot more money than is necessary to be quite sure we'd detect any important effects.  The most common practice is to identify the sample size where the power is around 80%, and sometimes 90%. Other values may be reasonable for a specific context, but 80% and 90% are most commonly targeted as a good balance between high power and not exposing too many patients to a new treatment (or wasting too much money).  We could compute the power of the test at several other possible sample sizes until we find one that's close to 80%, but there's a better way. We should solve the problem backwards.    What sample size will lead to a power of 80%? Use .    We'll assume we have a large enough sample that the normal distribution is a good approximation for the test statistic, since the normal distribution and the -distribution look almost identical when the degrees of freedom are moderately large (e.g. ). If that doesn't turn out to be true, then we'd need to make a correction.  We start by identifying the Z-score that would give us a lower tail of 80%. For a moderately large sample size per group, the Z-score for a lower tail of 80% would be about .   Additionally, the rejection region extends from the center of the null distribution for . This allows us to calculate the target distance between the center of the null and alternative distributions in terms of the standard error: In our example, we want the distance between the null and alternative distributions' centers to equal the minimum effect size of interest, 3 mmHg, which allows us to set up an equation between this difference and the standard error: We should target 251 patients per group in order to achieve 80% power at the 0.05 significance level for this context.    The standard error difference of is specific to a context where the targeted power is 80% and the significance level is . If the targeted power is 90% or if we use a different significance level, then we'll use something a little different than .  Had the suggested sample size been relatively small -- roughly 30 or smaller -- it would have been a good idea to rework the calculations using the degrees of fredom for the smaller sample size under that initial sample size. That is, we would have revised the 0.84 and 1.96 values based on degrees of freedom implied by the initial sample size. The revised sample size target would generally have then been a little larger.    Suppose the targeted power was 90% and we were using . How many standard errors should separate the centers of the null and alternative distribution, where the alternative distribution is centered at the minimum effect size of interest?    First, find the Z-score such that 90% of the distribution is below it: . Next, find the cutoffs for the rejection regions: . Then the difference in centers should be about .      What are some considerations that are important in determining what the power should be for an experiment?    Answers will vary, but here are a few important considerations:   Whether there is any risk to patients in the study.    The cost of enrolling more patients.    The potential downside of not detecting an effect of interest.        Figure shows the power for sample sizes from 20 patients to 5,000 patients when and the true difference is -3. This curve was constructed by writing a program to compute the power for many different sample sizes.    The curve shows the power for different sample sizes in the context of the blood pressure example when the true difference is -3. Having more than about 250 to 350 observations doesn't provide much additional value in detecting an effect when .   Power calculations for expensive or risky experiments are critical. However, what about experiments that are inexpensive and where the ethical considerations are minimal? For example, if we are doing final testing on a new feature on a popular website, how would our sample size considerations change? As before, we'd want to make sure the sample is big enough. However, suppose the feature has undergone some testing and is known to perform well (e.g. the website's users seem to enjoy the feature). Then it may be reasonable to run a larger experiment if there's value from having a more precise estimate of the feature's effect, such as helping guide the development of the next useful feature.

  "title": "Comparing many means with ANOVA",
  "body": " Comparing many means with ANOVA  Sometimes we want to compare means across many groups. We might initially think to do pairwise comparisons. For example, if there were three groups, we might be tempted to compare the first mean with the second, then with the third, and then finally compare the second and third means for a total of three comparisons. However, this strategy can be treacherous. If we have many groups and do many comparisons, it is likely that we will eventually find a difference just by chance, even if there is no difference in the populations. Instead, we should apply a holistic test to check whether there is evidence that at least one pair of groups are in fact different, and this is where ANOVA saves the day.   Core ideas of ANOVA  In this section, we will learn a new method called analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a new test statistic called . ANOVA uses a single hypothesis test to check whether the means across many groups are equal:   : The mean outcome is the same across all groups. In statistical notation, where represents the mean of the outcome for observations in category .  : At least one mean is different.   Generally we must check three conditions on the data before performing ANOVA:   the observations are independent within and across groups,  the data within each group are nearly normal, and  the variability across the groups is about equal.   When these three conditions are met, we may perform an ANOVA to determine whether the data provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis that all the are equal.    College departments commonly run multiple lectures of the same introductory course each semester because of high demand. Consider a statistics department that runs three lectures of an introductory statistics course. We might like to determine whether there are statistically significant differences in first exam scores in these three classes ( , , and ). Describe appropriate hypotheses to determine whether there are any differences between the three classes.    The hypotheses may be written in the following form:   : The average score is identical in all lectures. Any observed difference is due to chance. Notationally, we write .  : The average score varies by class. We would reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis if there were larger differences among the class averages than what we might expect from chance alone.     Strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis in ANOVA is described by unusually large differences among the group means. We will soon learn that assessing the variability of the group means relative to the variability among individual observations within each group is key to ANOVA's success.    Examine . Compare groups I, II, and III. Can you visually determine if the differences in the group centers is due to chance or not? Now compare groups IV, V, and VI. Do these differences appear to be due to chance?    Any real difference in the means of groups I, II, and III is difficult to discern, because the data within each group are very volatile relative to any differences in the average outcome. On the other hand, it appears there are differences in the centers of groups IV, V, and VI. For instance, group V appears to have a higher mean than that of the other two groups. Investigating groups IV, V, and VI, we see the differences in the groups' centers are noticeable because those differences are large relative to the variability in the individual observations within each group .     Side-by-side dot plot for the outcomes for six groups.    Side-by-side dot plots are shown for groups I, II, III, IV, V, and VI. The means for I and IV are the same, the means of II and V are the same, and the means of III and VI are also the same. However, the variability of the data shown in groups I, II, and III is larger than the variability of the groups IV, V, and VI.      Is batting performance related to player position in MLB?  We would like to discern whether there are real differences between the batting performance of baseball players according to their position: outfielder (OF), infielder (IF), and catcher (C). We will use a data set called bat18 , which includes batting records of 429 Major League Baseball (MLB) players from the 2018 season who had at least 100 at bats. Six of the 429 cases represented in bat18 are shown in , and descriptions for each variable are provided in .

The player positions have been divided into three groups: outfield (OF), infield (IF), and catcher (C). What would be an appropriate point estimate of the on-base percentage by outfielders, ?    A good estimate of the on-base percentage by outfielders would be the sample average of OBP for just those players whose position is outfield: .     provides summary statistics for each group. A side-by-side box plot for the on-base percentage is shown in . Notice that the variability appears to be approximately constant across groups; nearly constant variance across groups is an important assumption that must be satisfied before we consider the ANOVA approach.

With over a hundred players in both the infield and outfield groups, a few individual points are shown but are not concerning.      The largest difference between the sample means is between the catcher and the outfielder positions. Consider again the original hypotheses:   :  : The average on-base percentage ( ) varies across some (or all) groups.   Why might it be inappropriate to run the test by simply estimating whether the difference of and is statistically significant at a 0.05 significance level?    The primary issue here is that we are inspecting the data before picking the groups that will be compared. It is inappropriate to examine all data by eye (informal testing) and only afterwards decide which parts to formally test. This is called data snooping or data fishing . Naturally, we would pick the groups with the large differences for the formal test, and this would lead to an inflation in the Type 1 Error rate. To understand this better, let's consider a slightly different problem.  Suppose we are to measure the aptitude for students in 20 classes in a large elementary school at the beginning of the year. In this school, all students are randomly assigned to classrooms, so any differences we observe between the classes at the start of the year are completely due to chance. However, with so many groups, we will probably observe a few groups that look rather different from each other. If we select only these classes that look so different and then perform a formal test, we will probably make the wrong conclusion that the assignment wasn't random. While we might only formally test differences for a few pairs of classes, we informally evaluated the other classes by eye before choosing the most extreme cases for a comparison.    For additional information on the ideas expressed in , we recommend reading about the prosecutor's fallacy .  In the next section we will learn how to use the statistic and ANOVA to test whether observed differences in sample means could have happened just by chance even if there was no difference in the respective population means.    Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the -test  The method of analysis of variance in this context focuses on answering one question: is the variability in the sample means so large that it seems unlikely to be from chance alone? This question is different from earlier testing procedures since we will simultaneously consider many groups, and evaluate whether their sample means differ more than we would expect from natural variation. We call this variability the mean square between groups (MSG) , and it has an associated degrees of freedom, when there are groups. The can be thought of as a scaled variance formula for means. If the null hypothesis is true, any variation in the sample means is due to chance and shouldn't be too large. However, we typically use software for these computations.  The mean square between the groups is, on its own, quite useless in a hypothesis test. We need a benchmark value for how much variability should be expected among the sample means if the null hypothesis is true. To this end, we compute a pooled variance estimate, often abbreviated as the mean square error (MSE) , which has an associated degrees of freedom value . It is helpful to think of as a measure of the variability within the groups.  When the null hypothesis is true, any differences among the sample means are only due to chance, and the and should be about equal. As a test statistic for ANOVA, we examine the fraction of and :   The represents a measure of the between-group variability, and measures the variability within each of the groups.    For the baseball data, and . Identify the degrees of freedom associated with MSG and MSE and verify the statistic is approximately 5.077.    There are groups, so . There are total observations, so . Then the statistic is computed as the ratio of and : .    We can use the statistic to evaluate the hypotheses in what is called an F-test . A p-value can be computed from the statistic using an distribution, which has two associated parameters: and . For the statistic in ANOVA, and . An distribution with 2 and 426 degrees of freedom, corresponding to the statistic for the baseball hypothesis test, is shown in .   An distribution with and .    An F distribution with df-sub-1 equals 2 and df-sub-2 equals 426 is shown. This distribution starts at zero and runs up (and past) a value of 8. The distribution is strongly right skewed. The distribution peaks right at 0 and tapers off quickly, with about 5 percent to 10 percent of the distribution lying above a value of 2. The distribution is indistinguishable from the horizontal axis by about 5. The figure also annotates a small tail area at and above values of 5.    The larger the observed variability in the sample means ( ) relative to the within-group observations ( ), the larger will be and the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. Because larger values of represent stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, we use the upper tail of the distribution to compute a p-value.   The statistic and the -test  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to test whether the mean outcome differs across 2 or more groups. ANOVA uses a test statistic , which represents a standardized ratio of variability in the sample means relative to the variability within the groups. If is true and the model conditions are satisfied, the statistic follows an distribution with parameters and . The upper tail of the distribution is used to represent the p-value.     The p-value corresponding to the shaded area in is equal to about 0.0066. Does this provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis?    The p-value is smaller than 0.05, indicating the evidence is strong enough to reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05. That is, the data provide strong evidence that the average on-base percentage varies by player's primary field position.      Reading an ANOVA table from software  The calculations required to perform an ANOVA by hand are tedious and prone to human error. For these reasons, it is common to use statistical software to calculate the statistic and p-value.  An ANOVA can be summarized in a table very similar to that of a regression summary, which we will see in later chapters. shows an ANOVA summary to test whether the mean of on-base percentage varies by player positions in the MLB. Many of these values should look familiar; in particular, the -test statistic and p-value can be retrieved from the last two columns.   ANOVA summary for testing whether the average on-base percentage differs across player positions     Df  Sum Sq  Mean Sq  F value  Pr( )    position  2  0.0161  0.0080  5.0766  0.0066    Residuals  426  0.6740  0.0016              on       Graphical diagnostics for an ANOVA analysis  There are three conditions we must check for an ANOVA analysis: all observations must be independent, the data in each group must be nearly normal, and the variance within each group must be approximately equal.    Independence.  If the data are a simple random sample, this condition is satisfied. For processes and experiments, carefully consider whether the data may be independent (e.g. no pairing). For example, in the MLB data, the data were not sampled. However, there are not obvious reasons why independence would not hold for most or all observations.    Approximately normal.  As with one- and two-sample testing for means, the normality assumption is especially important when the sample size is quite small when it is ironically difficult to check for non-normality. A histogram of the observations from each group is shown in . Since each of the groups we're considering have relatively large sample sizes, what we're looking for are major outliers. None are apparent, so this condition is reasonably met.   Histograms of OBP for each field position.    Three histograms are shown, one for Outfielders, one for Infielders, and one for Catchers. The Outfielders and Infielders are centered slightly above 0.3, while the Catchers distribution is centered at about 0.3. The variability in each group is about 0.03. Each of the distributions somewhat resemble normal distributions and do not have any major outliers.      Constant variance.  The last assumption is that the variance in the groups is about equal from one group to the next. This assumption can be checked by examining a side-by-side box plot of the outcomes across the groups, as in . In this case, the variability is similar in the three groups but not identical. We see in that the standard deviation doesn't vary much from one group to the next.     Diagnostics for an ANOVA analysis  Independence is always important to an ANOVA analysis. The normality condition is very important when the sample sizes for each group are relatively small. The constant variance condition is especially important when the sample sizes differ between groups.     Multiple comparisons and controlling Type 1 Error rate  When we reject the null hypothesis in an ANOVA analysis, we might wonder, which of these groups have different means? To answer this question, we compare the means of each possible pair of groups. For instance, if there are three groups and there is strong evidence that there are some differences in the group means, there are three comparisons to make: group 1 to group 2, group 1 to group 3, and group 2 to group 3. These comparisons can be accomplished using a two-sample -test, but we use a modified significance level and a pooled estimate of the standard deviation across groups. Usually this pooled standard deviation can be found in the ANOVA table, e.g. along the bottom of .     discussed three statistics lectures, all taught during the same semester. shows summary statistics for these three courses, and a side-by-side box plot of the data is shown in . We would like to conduct an ANOVA for these data. Do you see any deviations from the three conditions for ANOVA?    In this case (like many others) it is difficult to check independence in a rigorous way. Instead, the best we can do is use common sense to consider reasons the assumption of independence may not hold. For instance, the independence assumption may not be reasonable if there is a star teaching assistant that only half of the students may access; such a scenario would divide a class into two subgroups. No such situations were evident for these particular data, and we believe that independence is acceptable.  The distributions in the side-by-side box plot appear to be roughly symmetric and show no noticeable outliers.  The box plots show approximately equal variability, which can be verified in , supporting the constant variance assumption.     Summary statistics for the first midterm scores in three different lectures of the same course    Class  A  B  C     58  55  51     75.1  72.0  78.9     13.9  13.8  13.1      Side-by-side box plot for the first midterm scores in three different lectures of the same course.    Side-by-side box plot for the first midterm scores in three different lectures of the same course. Lecture A has a box from about 65 to 85, a median of 73, and whiskers that extend down to 45 and up to 100. Lecture B has a box from about 62 to 82, a median of 72, and whiskers that extend down to 40 and up to 100. Lecture C has a box from about 73 to 88, a median of 82, and whiskers that extend down to 45 and up to 100.      ANOVA was conducted for the midterm data, and summary results are shown in . What should we conclude?    The p-value of the test is 0.0330, less than the default significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in the average midterm scores is not due to chance.     ANOVA summary table for the midterm data     Df  Sum Sq  Mean Sq  F value  Pr( )    lecture  2  1290.11  645.06  3.48  0.0330    Residuals  161  29810.13  185.16              on     There is strong evidence that the different means in each of the three classes are not simply due to chance. We might wonder, which of the classes are actually different? As discussed in earlier chapters, a two-sample -test could be used to test for differences in each possible pair of groups. However, one pitfall was discussed in : when we run so many tests, the Type 1 Error rate increases. This issue is resolved by using a modified significance level.   Multiple comparisons and the Bonferroni correction for  The scenario of testing many pairs of groups is called multiple comparisons . The Bonferroni correction suggests that a more stringent significance level is more appropriate for these tests:   where is the number of comparisons being considered (formally or informally). If there are groups, then usually all possible pairs are compared and .     In the previous exercise, you found strong evidence of differences in the average midterm grades between the three lectures. Complete the three possible pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni correction and report any differences.    We use a modified significance level of . Additionally, we use the pooled estimate of the standard deviation: on , which is provided in the ANOVA summary table.   Lecture A versus Lecture B: The estimated difference and standard error are, respectively,   This results in a T-score of 1.21 on (we use the associated with ). Statistical software was used to precisely identify the two-sided p-value since the modified significance level of 0.0167 is not found in the -table. The p-value (0.228) is larger than , so there is not strong evidence of a difference in the means of lectures A and B.   Lecture A versus Lecture C: The estimated difference and standard error are 3.8 and 2.61, respectively. This results in a score of 1.46 on and a two-sided p-value of 0.1462. This p-value is larger than , so there is not strong evidence of a difference in the means of lectures A and C.   Lecture B versus Lecture C: The estimated difference and standard error are 6.9 and 2.65, respectively. This results in a score of 2.60 on and a two-sided p-value of 0.0102. This p-value is smaller than . Here we find strong evidence of a difference in the means of lectures B and C.    We might summarize the findings of the analysis from using the following notation:   The midterm mean in lecture A is not statistically distinguishable from those of lectures B or C. However, there is strong evidence that lectures B and C are different. In the first two pairwise comparisons, we did not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Recall that failing to reject does not imply is true.   Reject with ANOVA but find no differences in group means  It is possible to reject the null hypothesis using ANOVA and then to not subsequently identify differences in the pairwise comparisons. However, this does not invalidate the ANOVA conclusion . It only means we have not been able to successfully identify which specific groups differ in their means.   The ANOVA procedure examines the big picture: it considers all groups simultaneously to decipher whether there is evidence that some difference exists. Even if the test indicates that there is strong evidence of differences in group means, identifying with high confidence a specific difference as statistically significant is more difficult.  Consider the following analogy: we observe a Wall Street firm that makes large quantities of money based on predicting mergers. Mergers are generally difficult to predict, and if the prediction success rate is extremely high, that may be considered sufficiently strong evidence to warrant investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the SEC may be quite certain that there is insider trading taking place at the firm, the evidence against any single trader may not be very strong. It is only when the SEC considers all the data that they identify the pattern. This is effectively the strategy of ANOVA: stand back and consider all the groups simultaneously.   "

In this case (like many others) it is difficult to check independence in a rigorous way. Instead, the best we can do is use common sense to consider reasons the assumption of independence may not hold. For instance, the independence assumption may not be reasonable if there is a star teaching assistant that only half of the students may access; such a scenario would divide a class into two subgroups. No such situations were evident for these particular data, and we believe that independence is acceptable.  The distributions in the side-by-side box plot appear to be roughly symmetric and show no noticeable outliers.  The box plots show approximately equal variability, which can be verified in , supporting the constant variance assumption.   "

  "title": "Fitting a line, residuals, and correlation",
  "body": " Fitting a line, residuals, and correlation   It's helpful to think deeply about the line fitting process. In this section, we define the form of a linear model, explore criteria for what makes a good fit, and introduce a new statistic called correlation .    Fitting a line to data   shows two variables whose relationship can be modeled perfectly with a straight line. The equation for the line is Consider what a perfect linear relationship means: we know the exact value of just by knowing the value of . This is unrealistic in almost any natural process. For example, if we took family income ( ), this value would provide some useful information about how much financial support a college may offer a prospective student ( ). However, the prediction would be far from perfect, since other factors play a role in financial support beyond a family's finances.   Requests from twelve separate buyers were simultaneously placed with a trading company to purchase Target Corporation stock (ticker TGT, December 28th, 2018), and the total cost of the shares were reported. Because the cost is computed using a linear formula, the linear fit is perfect.   A scatterplot with a straight line fit to the data are shown for the date December 28th, 2018. The horizontal axis is \"Number of Target Corporation Stocks to Purchase\" and the vertical axis is \"Total Cost of the Shares Purchase\". Twelve data points are shown that all fall exactly on a straight line with an equation of y equals 5 plus 64.96 times x. Because the cost is computed using a linear formula, this explains why the linear fit is perfect.    Linear regression is the statistical method for fitting a line to data where the relationship between two variables, and , can be modeled by a straight line with some error: The values and represent the model's parameters ( is the Greek letter beta ), and the error is represented by (the Greek letter epsilon ). The parameters are estimated using data, and we write their point estimates as and . When we use to predict , we usually call the explanatory variable or predictor variable, and we call the response ; we also often drop the term when writing down the model since our main focus is often on the prediction of the average outcome.  It is rare for all of the data to fall perfectly on a straight line. Instead, it's more common for data to appear as a cloud of points , such as those examples shown in . In each case, the data fall around a straight line, even if none of the observations fall exactly on the line. The first plot shows a relatively strong downward linear trend, where the remaining variability in the data around the line is minor relative to the strength of the relationship between and . The second plot shows an upward trend that, while evident, is not as strong as the first. The last plot shows a very weak downward trend in the data, so slight we can hardly notice it. In each of these examples, we will have some uncertainty regarding our estimates of the model parameters, and . For instance, we might wonder, should we move the line up or down a little, or should we tilt it more or less? As we move forward in this chapter, we will learn about criteria for line-fitting, and we will also learn about the uncertainty associated with estimates of model parameters.   Three data sets where a linear model may be useful even though the data do not all fall exactly on the line.   Three scatterplots are shown. The first has data ranging from -50 to positive 50 on both the horizontal and vertical axes. The data start in the upper left corner of the plot and then move steadily down to the right corner. The second plot has the horizontal axis running from 500 to about 2,000 and the vertical axis from about 0 to 25,000. At the left side of the plot, the data are in the lower half of the plot, and the points generally are steadily higher as we move right, where most points near the right end of the plot are in the upper region of the plot. A upwards trending line has been fit to these points. The last plot runs from about -10 to positive 50 on the horizontal axis and about -200 to positive 400 on the vertical axis. The points are scattered broadly across the range, with only the slightest downward trend evident in the data. A trend line has been fit to this data, though it is nearly flat.    There are also cases where fitting a straight line to the data, even if there is a clear relationship between the variables, is not helpful. One such case is shown in where there is a very clear relationship between the variables even though the trend is not linear. We discuss nonlinear trends in this chapter and the next, but details of fitting nonlinear models are saved for a later course.   A linear model is not useful in this nonlinear case. These data are from an introductory physics experiment.   A linear model is not useful in a nonlinear set of data shown in this plot. The data are from an introductory physics experiment, where a ball is shot at many angles of inclination between 0 degrees and 90 degrees (represented by the horizontal axis), and the measured horizontal distance traveled by the ball before it hits the ground is shown in meters. The first point, at an angle of inclination of 0 hits the ground at 0 meters traveled. As the angle is increased, the ball travels further before it hits the ground until reaching a peak at 45 degrees angle of inclination, at which point it decreases again until we reach an angle of 90 degrees, at which point the ball again does not travel any horizontal distance before it hits the ground. For the data shown, the best fitting straight line is shown and is flat. This is a good example of why a straight line fit to data where there is curvature is often not useful.      Using linear regression to predict possum head lengths  Brushtail possums are a marsupial that lives in Australia, and a photo of one is shown in . Researchers captured 104 of these animals and took body measurements before releasing the animals back into the wild. We consider two of these measurements: the total length of each possum, from head to tail, and the length of each possum's head.   The common brushtail possum of Australia. Photo by Greg Schechter (https:\/\/flic.kr\/p\/9BAFbR). CC BY 2.0 license.   A common brushtail possum of Australia is shown. It has a brown fur coat with some gray sprinkled in along with a face and ears that somewhat resemble a house cat. The possum also has a big bushy tail.     shows a scatterplot for the head length and total length of the possums. Each point represents a single possum from the data. The head and total length variables are associated: possums with an above average total length also tend to have above average head lengths. While the relationship is not perfectly linear, it could be helpful to partially explain the connection between these variables with a straight line.   A scatterplot showing head length against total length for 104 brushtail possums. A point representing a possum with head length 94.1mm and total length 89cm is highlighted.   A scatterplot showing head length against total length for 104 brushtail possums, where the horizontal axis for total length runs from 75 centimeters to about 97 centimeters (2.5 to 3.3 feet) and the vertical axis for head length runs from about 82 millimeters up to about 104 millimeters (3 to 4 inches). For possums with a total length between 75 to 80 centimeters, there are three points shown, each with head lengths of about 85 millimeters. For possums with total length from 80 to 85 centimeters, most head lengths range from about 85 millimeters to 95 millimeters. For possums with total lengths from 85 to 90 centimeters, head lengths mostly lie between 90 millimeters and 97 millimeters. For possums with total lengths larger than 90 centimeters, the head lengths are mostly between 93 millimeters and 100 millimeters. The trend is evidently upward and approximately linear. A point representing a possum with head length 94.1mm and total length 89cm is highlighted (although not relevant for any other purpose than giving an example or reminder for how a point is read in a scatterplot).    We want to describe the relationship between the head length and total length variables in the possum data set using a line. In this example, we will use the total length as the predictor variable, , to predict a possum's head length, . We could fit the linear relationship by eye, as in . The equation for this line is A \"hat\" on is used to signify that this is an estimate. We can use this line to discuss properties of possums. For instance, the equation predicts a possum with a total length of 80 cm will have a head length of The estimate may be viewed as an average: the equation predicts that possums with a total length of 80 cm will have an average head length of 88.2 mm. Absent further information about an 80 cm possum, the prediction for head length that uses the average is a reasonable estimate.   A reasonable linear model was fit to represent the relationship between head length and total length.   The same scatterplot showing head length against total length for 104 brushtail possums is shown. A linear trend line has been added with an equation of y-hat equals 41 plus 0.59 times x, which shows the clear upward trajectory of the data. Additionally, three points are highlighted. The first is labeled with an \"X\" and is at approximately (77, 85) and lies about 1 unit below the trend line. A second point labeled with a \"plus sign\" is at about (85, 98) and appears to be about 7 units above the trend line. The last point highlighted is a \"triangle\" and is located at about (95, 93) and is about 3 units below the trend line.      What other variables might help us predict the head length of a possum besides its length?    Perhaps the relationship would be a little different for male possums than female possums, or perhaps it would differ for possums from one region of Australia versus another region. In , we'll learn about how we can include more than one predictor. Before we get there, we first need to better understand how to best build a simple linear model with one predictor.      Residuals   Residuals are the leftover variation in the data after accounting for the model fit: Each observation will have a residual, and three of the residuals for the linear model we fit for the possum data is shown in . If an observation is above the regression line, then its residual, the vertical distance from the observation to the line, is positive. Observations below the line have negative residuals. One goal in picking the right linear model is for these residuals to be as small as possible.  Let's look closer at the three residuals featured in . The observation marked by an \" \" has a small, negative residual of about -1; the observation marked by \" \" has a large residual of about +7; and the observation marked by \" \" has a moderate residual of about -4. The size of a residual is usually discussed in terms of its absolute value. For example, the residual for \" \" is larger than that of \" \" because is larger than .   Residual: difference between observed and expected  The residual of the observation is the difference of the observed response ( ) and the response we would predict based on the model fit ( ): We typically identify by plugging into the model.     The linear fit shown in is given as . Based on this line, formally compute the residual of the observation . This observation is denoted by \" \" in . Check it against the earlier visual estimate, -1.    We first compute the predicted value of point \" \" based on the model: Next we compute the difference of the actual head length and the predicted head length: The model's error is mm, which is very close to the visual estimate of -1 mm. The negative residual indicates that the linear model overpredicted head length for this particular possum.      If a model underestimates an observation, will the residual be positive or negative? What about if it overestimates the observation?    If a model underestimates an observation, then the model estimate is below the actual. The residual, which is the actual observation value minus the model estimate, must then be positive. The opposite is true when the model overestimates the observation: the residual is negative.      Compute the residuals for the \" \" observation and the \" \" observation in the figure using the linear relationship .    ( ) First compute the predicted value based on the model: Then the residual is given by This was close to the earlier estimate of 7.  ( ) . , close to the estimate of -4.    Residuals are helpful in evaluating how well a linear model fits a data set. We often display them in a residual plot such as the one shown in for the regression line in . The residuals are plotted at their original horizontal locations but with the vertical coordinate as the residual. For instance, the point had a residual of 7.45, so in the residual plot it is placed at . Creating a residual plot is sort of like tipping the scatterplot over so the regression line is horizontal.   Residual plot for the model in .   A residual plot for the trend line fit to the brushtail possum data is shown. Here, the horizontal axis is the same -- representing \"total length\", it spans 75 to 97 -- while the vertical axis represents \"Residuals\" and spans from about -7 to positive 8. There is no evident trend in the residuals. Three points are specifically highlighted to reflect the three points discussed in the last figure. The first is labeled with an \"X\" with a total length of 77 and a residual of about -1. The second is labeled with a \"plus sign\" and has a total length of 85 and a residual of about 7. The last point highlighted is a \"triangle\" with a total length of about 95 and a residual of about -3. Note that the location of the residuals above and below the trend line reflects exactly with whether the residual is positive or negative, respectively.      One purpose of residual plots is to identify characteristics or patterns still apparent in data after fitting a model. shows three scatterplots with linear models in the first row and residual plots in the second row. Can you identify any patterns remaining in the residuals?    In the first data set (first column), the residuals show no obvious patterns. The residuals appear to be scattered randomly around the dashed line that represents 0.  The second data set shows a pattern in the residuals. There is some curvature in the scatterplot, which is more obvious in the residual plot. We should not use a straight line to model these data. Instead, a more advanced technique should be used.  The last plot shows very little upwards trend, and the residuals also show no obvious patterns. It is reasonable to try to fit a linear model to the data. However, it is unclear whether there is statistically significant evidence that the slope parameter is different from zero. The point estimate of the slope parameter, labeled , is not zero, but we might wonder if this could just be due to chance. We will address this sort of scenario in .     Sample data with their best fitting lines (top row) and their corresponding residual plots (bottom row).   Sample data with their best fitting lines (top row of three plots) and their corresponding residual plots (bottom row of three plots). The upper left plot shows a scatterplot where the data trend downwards steadily with a straight line fit to the data, which appears to fit well everywhere. The bottom left plot is the residual plot of this first scatterplot, and it likewise shows no pattern in the residuals when looking left to right. The upper middle plot shows data with a downward trend, but the data's trend is more steep on the right side of the plot, so the overall shape of the data is that it trends downward and curves downward. A straight, downward-trending line has also been fit to this data, but it doesn't fit as well. The data are below this downward trending line initially, but it is above the line in the middle, and finally on the right it is once again below the linear trend line. The residual plot for this scatterplot is shown in the lower middle plot, and the curvature in the residuals is more evident than what was visible in the scatterplot: the residuals have negative values on the left and trend upwards until peaking with positive residuals in the middle, and then trending back down and having negative residual values again on the right. The last scatterplot in the upper right shows data with very little trend, but a slightly-upward trending straight line has been fit to the data. The corresponding residual plot, shown as the bottom right plot, also shows data with no evident trend or pattern, where observations appear relatively randomly scattered above and below 0 (in the vertical).      Describing linear relationships with correlation  We've seen plots with strong linear relationships and others with very weak linear relationships. It would be useful if we could quantify the strength of these linear relationships with a statistic.   Correlation: strength of a linear relationship   Correlation , which always takes values between -1 and 1, describes the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. We denote the correlation by .   We can compute the correlation using a formula, just as we did with the sample mean and standard deviation. This formula is rather complex, Formally, we can compute the correlation for observations , , , using the formula where , , , and are the sample means and standard deviations for each variable. and like with other statistics, we generally perform the calculations on a computer or calculator. shows eight plots and their corresponding correlations. Only when the relationship is perfectly linear is the correlation either -1 or 1. If the relationship is strong and positive, the correlation will be near +1. If it is strong and negative, it will be near -1. If there is no apparent linear relationship between the variables, then the correlation will be near zero.   Sample scatterplots and their correlations. The first row shows variables with a positive relationship, represented by the trend up and to the right. The second row shows one plot with an approximately neutral trend and three plots with a negative trend.   Eight scatterplots are shown, each with their correlation noted. Each scatterplot appears to represent about 50 points. The first has a correlation of R equals 0.33, and there is a slight upward trend evident in the data -- if a trend line were drawn for this data, much of the data would fall relatively far from the line. The second plot has a correlation of R equals 0.69, and a clearer upward trend is evident, but it is still pretty volatile with many points deviating far from where the trend line would be. The third plot has a correlation of 0.98, and the data show a very clear upward trend, where if a trend line were drawn, the data would be (relatively) quite close to this line. The fourth plot shows a correlation of R equals 1.00, and here the points appear exactly on a line with an upward trajectory. The fifth plot shows data with a correlation of R equals 0.08, where no trend is visually evident in the data. The sixth plot has a correlation of R equals -0.64, and a downward trend is evident in the data, but the individual observations would in many cases be pretty distant from any trend line fit to the data (on a relative basis). The seventh plot has a correlation of R equals -0.92 and shows data with a clear downward trend, where the data would deviate just a modest amount from a trend line fit to the data. The last plot shows a correlation of R equals -1, where the observations would fit exactly on a line trending downwards.    The correlation is intended to quantify the strength of a linear trend. Nonlinear trends, even when strong, sometimes produce correlations that do not reflect the strength of the relationship; see three such examples in .   Sample scatterplots and their correlations. In each case, there is a strong relationship between the variables. However, because the relationship is nonlinear, the correlation is relatively weak.   Three scatterplots are shown. In each case, there is a strong relationship between the variables. However, because the relationship is nonlinear, the correlation is relatively weak. The first plot shows data that trends upwards on the left before peaking and then trending downward on the right -- the correlation of the data in this plot is R equals -0.23. The second plot shows data with a sharp downward trend on the left before reaching a trough and rising then sharply upward before reaching a peak and then trending sharply downwards again -- the correlation of the data in this plot is R equals 0.31. The third plot shows data that without a trend on the far left, followed by a steep drop, a trough, and then a steep rise to a peak, and then another drop and then finally a slight increase at the end -- the correlation of the data in this plot is R equals 0.50.      No straight line is a good fit for the data sets represented in . Try drawing nonlinear curves on each plot. Once you create a curve for each, describe what is important in your fit.    We'll leave it to you to draw the lines. In general, the lines you draw should be close to most points and reflect overall trends in the data.       Section 8.1 Exercises   Visualize the residuals   The scatterplots shown below each have a superimposed regression line. If we were to construct a residual plot (residuals versus ) for each, describe what those plots would look like.    A scatterplot is shown, where the data have a steady upward trend throughout. The observations above and below the line appear random and have stable variability moving from left to right.    A scatterplot is shown, where the data have a steady upward trend throughout. The observations above and below the line appear random. If looking at the leftmost region of data, the observations are more broadly scattered around the line, while when moving further right the variability of the points around the line gets notably smaller by a factor of at least 5 (if using standard deviation).       Trends in the residuals   Shown below are two plots of residuals remaining after fitting a linear model to two different sets of data. Describe important features and determine if a linear model would be appropriate for these data. Explain your reasoning.    A scatterplot of the residuals is shown. When looking at any horizontal region of the plot, the observations are consistently scattered around the \"y equals 0\" line. On the left, the points tend to be very close to this horizontal 0 line. The further moving to the right, the more variability that is evident in the observations around \"y equals 0\".    A scatterplot of the residuals is shown. The points on the very left tend to be below the \"y equals 0\" line for the first 5% of the horizontal region, where the trend is sharply upwards to the \"y equals 0\" line. The points then tend to be stably clustered around \"y equals 0\", if not slightly above, with a slight downward trend evident in the observations on the right half of the plot. The vertical variability of observations is about stable throughout.       Identify relationships, Part I   For each of the six plots, identify the strength of the relationship (e.g. weak, moderate, or strong) in the data and whether fitting a linear model would be reasonable.    A scatterplot is shown. The observations start in the upper left corner of the plot, trend sharply downwards before tapering off and stabilizing at about the middle of the plot, before steadily and then faster rising again to the upper right corner of the plot. The trend is approximately symmetric from left-to-right.    A scatterplot is shown. The points start on the lower left corner, only spanning about 20% of the vertical region of the plot, and have a steady upwards trend to the upper right corner of the plot. The vertical variability of the points around the trend is relatively stable across the plot.    A scatterplot is shown. On the left side of the plot, the points appear randomly scattered across the full range of the plot, and this property holds across the entire plot. No trend is evident.      A scatterplot is shown. On the left side of the plot, the observations are concentrated in the bottom half of the plot but rise steadily. The trend peaks near the center of the plot, where nearly all the points in the (horizontal) center region of the scatterplot are concentrated in the upper half of the scatterplot. On the right side of the plot, the points show a trend downwards, with points concentrated in the lower quarter of the scatterplot for the rightmost handful of points.    A scatterplot is shown. The points start on the upper left corner, only spanning about 20% of the vertical region of the plot, and have a steady downwards trend to the bottom right corner of the plot. The vertical variability of the points around the trend is relatively stable across the plot.    A scatterplot is shown. On the left side of the plot, the points appear randomly scattered across the full range of the plot, and this property holds across the entire plot. No trend is evident or at least obvious.       Identify relationships, Part II   For each of the six plots, identify the strength of the relationship (e.g. weak, moderate, or strong) in the data and whether fitting a linear model would be reasonable.    A scatterplot is shown. On the left side of the plot, the observations are concentrated in the upper corner of the plot, with a sharp trend downwards, before stabilizing, then rising slightly at halfway through the plot, reaching a peak, and then declining again, with a sharp decline on the right-most portion of the plot to the bottom-right corner of the plot.    A scatterplot is shown. On the left side of the plot, the observations are concentrated around a region about 30% of the way up from the bottom-left corner of the plot, there is a slight downward trend that reaches the bottom area of the plot for about the center half of the plot, then the points rise gradually and then sharply in the last 25-30% of the plot.    A scatterplot is shown. Points in the leftmost region of the plot are concentrated in the lower-left corner, ranging from the bottom up to about 25% of the way up the plot.

The points on the leftmost side are concentrated in the upper half of the plot, and the data trend steadily downwards and with consistent variability to the bottom right portion of the plot.       Exams and grades   The two scatterplots below show the relationship between final and mid-semester exam grades recorded during several years for a Statistics course at a university.    A scatter plot with 100 points is shown with an upward trending line fit to the data. Exam 1 scores are on the horizontal axis and range from 40 to 100. Final Exam scores are on the vertical axis and also range from 40 to 100. Only about ten Exam 1 scores are below 60, and these have Final Exam scores between about 55 and 85. Exam 1 scores between 60 and 80 represent about 50% of the points shown and have Final Exam scores mostly between 50 and 85. For the points where Midterm 1 scores are larger than 80, Final Exam scores mostly lie between 65 and 90, where a slightly upward trend is evident.    A scatter plot with 100 points is shown with an upward trending line fit to the data. Exam 2 scores are on the horizontal axis and range from 40 to 100. Final Exam scores are on the vertical axis and also range from 40 to 100. Midterm 2 scores are roughly uniformly distributed across the full range. For Exam 2 scores below 60, these mostly have Final Exam scores between about 45 and 70. Exam 2 scores between 60 and 80 have Final Exam scores mostly between 55 and 80. For the points where Midterm 2 scores are larger than 80, Final Exam scores mostly lie between 70 and 90.      Based on these graphs, which of the two exams has the strongest correlation with the final exam grade? Explain.  Can you think of a reason why the correlation between the exam you chose in part (a) and the final exam is higher?       Husbands and wives, Part I   The Great Britain Office of Population Census and Surveys once collected data on a random sample of 170 married couples in Britain, recording the age (in years) and heights (converted here to inches) of the husbands and wives. The scatterplot on the left shows the wife's age plotted against her husband's age, and the plot on the right shows wife's height plotted against husband's height.    A scatterplot is shown. The horizontal axis represents \"Husband's Age (in years)\" with values ranging from about 20 to 65. The vertical axis represents \"Wife's Age (in years)\" with values ranging from about 18 to 65. When husband age is between 20 and 30, wife age mostly ranges from 18 to about 30. When husband age is between 30 and 40, wife age mostly ranges from 23 to about 40. When husband age is between 40 and 50, wife age mostly ranges from 35 to about 50. When husband age is between 50 and 60, wife age mostly ranges from 45 to about 60. When husband age is larger than 60, wife age mostly ranges from 55 to about 65.    A scatterplot is shown. The horizontal axis represents \"Husband's Height (in inches)\" with values ranging from about 60 to 75. The vertical axis represents \"Wife's Height (in inches)\" with values ranging from about 55 to 70. When husband height is between 60 and 65, wife height mostly ranges from about 58 to 65 inches, though there are only about 10 points in this range, which is about 5% of the data. When husband height is between 65 and 70, wife height mostly ranges from 57 to 68 inches. When husband height is larger than 70 inches, wife height mostly ranges from 61 to about 74 inches.      Describe the relationship between husbands' and wives' ages.  Describe the relationship between husbands' and wives' heights.  Which plot shows a stronger correlation? Explain your reasoning.  Data on heights were originally collected in centimeters, and then converted to inches. Does this conversion affect the correlation between husbands' and wives' heights?       Match the correlation, Part I   Match each correlation to the corresponding scatterplot.            A scatterplot is shown. The observations start in the upper left corner of the plot, trend sharply downwards before tapering off and stabilizing at about the middle of the plot, before steadily and then faster rising again to the upper right corner of the plot. The trend is approximately symmetric from left-to-right.    A scatterplot is shown. The points start on the lower left corner, only spanning about 20% of the vertical region of the plot, and have a steady upwards trend to the upper right corner of the plot. The vertical variability of the points around the trend is relatively stable across the plot.    A scatterplot is shown. The points appear randomly scattered across the left, middle, and right portion of the plot. There is a very slight upward trend.    A scatterplot is shown. The points appear randomly scattered across the left, middle, and right portion of the plot. There is a very slight downward trend.       Match the correlation, Part II   Match each correlation to the corresponding scatterplot.            A scatterplot is shown. For the left half of the plot, the points are scattered around the upper half of the plot. On the right portion of the plot, the data show a clear downward trend, and for the points on the far right, they are concentrated in the lower 25% of the plot.    A scatterplot is shown. The points appear randomly scattered across the left, middle, and right portion of the plot. There is a very slight upward trend.    A scatterplot is shown. The observations start in the lower left corner of the plot, trend sharply upwards before tapering off and stabilizing at about the middle of the plot, before steadily and then faster dropping to the lower right corner of the plot. The trend is approximately symmetric from left-to-right.    A scatterplot is shown. The points appear randomly scattered across the left, middle, and right portion of the plot. There is a very slight downward trend.       Speed and height   1,302 UCLA students were asked to fill out a survey where they were asked about their height, fastest speed they have ever driven, and gender. The scatterplot on the left displays the relationship between height and fastest speed, and the scatterplot on the right displays the breakdown by gender in this relationship.    A scatterplot is shown. The horizontal axis represents \"Height (in inches)\" with values ranging from about 50 to 80. The vertical axis represents \"Fastest Speed (in mph)\" and has values ranging from 0 to 150. First, it is worth noting that there several points along the bottom of the plot with a fastest speed of 0 mph. The remainder of the description will concentrate on the other points. A small portion of the points are shown with heights below 60 inches, and these have fastest speeds mostly ranging from about 70 to 110 mph. For points shown with heights between 60 and 70, fastest speeds mostly ranged from about 30 to 120 mph. For points shown with heights of 70 or more, fastest speeds mostly ranged from about 50 to 140 mph. There were no points corresponding to heights greater than 75 that had fastest speeds slower than about 75 mph, which left a sort of gap in the lower right portion of the scatterplot.    A scatterplot is shown, where points are colored to differentiate between males and females. The horizontal axis represents \"Height (in inches)\" with values ranging from about 50 to 80. The vertical axis represents \"Fastest Speed (in mph)\" and has values ranging from 0 to 150. Female heights are largely 70 inches or smaller, while Male heights are largely 65 inches and taller. When focusing exclusively on Females, no upward trend is evident, with about 95% of observations having Fastest Speed between about 30 mph and 120 mph. When focusing exclusively on Males, no upward trend is evident there either, with about 95% of observations having Fastest Speed between about 50 mph and 140 mph. In contrast, if we ignore the male\/female differentiation, there is a slight upward trend in the points.      Describe the relationship between height and fastest speed.  Why do you think these variables are positively associated?  What role does gender play in the relationship between height and fastest driving speed?       Guess the correlation   Eduardo and Rosie are both collecting data on number of rainy days in a year and the total rainfall for the year. Eduardo records rainfall in inches and Rosie in centimeters. How will their correlation coefficients compare?     The Coast Starlight, Part I   The Coast Starlight Amtrak train runs from Seattle to Los Angeles. The scatterplot below displays the distance between each stop (in miles) and the amount of time it takes to travel from one stop to another (in minutes).      Describe the relationship between distance and travel time.  How would the relationship change if travel time was instead measured in hours, and distance was instead measured in kilometers?  The correlation between travel time (in miles) and distance (in minutes) is . Suppose we had instead measured travel time in hours and measured distance in kilometers (km). What would be the correlation in these different units?      A scatterplot is shown with about 15 points. The horizontal axis represents \"Distance (miles)\" with values ranging from just over 0 to about 350. The vertical axis represents \"Travel Time (in minutes)\" and has values ranging from about 20 to 380. The point with the smallest distance -- about 10 miles -- shows a travel time of about 40 minutes. Next, there is a cluster of 6 points with distances between 40 and 60 miles and travel times ranging from about 20 to 60 minutes. The remainder of the points are scattered pretty broadly but may show a slightly upward trend. A few points that highlight the widely varying nature of the data are located at the following approximate locations: (190 miles, 60 minutes), (240 miles, 250 minutes), (250 miles, 380 minutes), and (350 miles, 200 minutes).       Crawling babies, Part I   A study conducted at the University of Denver investigated whether babies take longer to learn to crawl in cold months, when they are often bundled in clothes that restrict their movement, than in warmer months. Infants born during the study year were split into twelve groups, one for each birth month. We consider the average crawling age of babies in each group against the average temperature when the babies are six months old (that's when babies often begin trying to crawl). Temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit ( F) and age is measured in weeks.      Describe the relationship between temperature and crawling age.  How would the relationship change if temperature was measured in degrees Celsius ( C) and age was measured in months?  The correlation between temperature in F and age in weeks was . If we converted the temperature to C and age to months, what would the correlation be?      A scatterplot is shown with a dozen points. The horizontal axis is \"Temperature (F)\" with values ranging from 30 to 75. The vertical axis is \"Average Crawling Age (weeks)\" with values ranging from 28.5 to 34. For those points with temperatures from 30 to 40, average crawling ages range from 31.5 to 34. For the single point with temperatures between 40 to 50, average crawling age was about 33.5. For the two points with temperature between 50 and 60, average crawling age was 28.5 and 32.5. For the last 4 points with temperature above 60, average crawling ages were 32, 30, 30, and 30.5.       Body measurements, Part I   Researchers studying anthropometry collected body girth measurements and skeletal diameter measurements, as well as age, weight, height and gender for 507 physically active individuals. The scatterplot below shows the relationship between height and shoulder girth (over deltoid muscles), both measured in centimeters.      Describe the relationship between shoulder girth and height.  How would the relationship change if shoulder girth was measured in inches while the units of height remained in centimeters?      A scatter plot with several hundred points is shown. The horizontal axis represents \"Shoulder Girth (cm)\" with values ranging from about 85 to 135. The vertical axis represents \"Height (cm)\" with values ranging from about 145 to 200. For points where Shoulder Girth is smaller than 100, 95% of points have heights between 152 and 170. For points where Shoulder Girth is between 100 and 110, 95% of points have heights between 155 and 180. For points where Shoulder Girth is between 110 and 120, 95% of points have heights between 162 and 190. For points where Shoulder Girth larger than 120, 95% of points have heights between 170 and 190.       Body measurements, Part II   The scatterplot below shows the relationship between weight measured in kilograms and hip girth measured in centimeters from the data described in .      Describe the relationship between hip girth and weight.  How would the relationship change if weight was measured in pounds while the units for hip girth remained in centimeters?      A scatter plot with several hundred points is shown. The horizontal axis represents \"Hip Girth (cm)\" with values ranging from about 80 to 115, with about 4 observations with larger hip girth up to about 130 cm. The vertical axis represents \"Weight (kg)\" with values ranging from about 40 to 105, with a few observations with larger weights up to 120. For points where Hip Girth is smaller than 90, 95% of points have weight between roughly 45 and 60. For points where Hip Girth is between 90 and 100, 95% of points have weight between roughly 50 and 80. For points where Hip Girth is between 100 and 110, 95% of points have weight between roughly 65 and 90. For points where Hip Girth is between 110 and 115, points have weight between roughly 70 and 105. There are four additional points located at about (115, 120), (115, 90), (118, 90), and (128, 105).       Correlation, Part I   What would be the correlation between the ages of husbands and wives if men always married women who were    3 years younger than themselves?  2 years older than themselves?  half as old as themselves?       Correlation, Part II   What would be the correlation between the annual salaries of males and females at a company if for a certain type of position men always made    $5,000 more than women?  25% more than women?  15% less than women?

The upper middle plot shows data with a downward trend, but the data's trend is more steep on the right side of the plot, so the overall shape of the data is that it trends downward and curves downward. A straight, downward-trending line has also been fit to this data, but it doesn't fit as well. The data are below this downward trending line initially, but it is above the line in the middle, and finally on the right it is once again below the linear trend line. The residual plot for this scatterplot is shown in the lower middle plot, and the curvature in the residuals is more evident than what was visible in the scatterplot: the residuals have negative values on the left and trend upwards until peaking with positive residuals in the middle, and then trending back down and having negative residual values again on the right. The last scatterplot in the upper right shows data with very little trend, but a slightly-upward trending straight line has been fit to the data. The corresponding residual plot, shown as the bottom right plot, also shows data with no evident trend or pattern, where observations appear relatively randomly scattered above and below 0 (in the vertical).

Gift aid is financial aid that does not need to be paid back, as opposed to a loan. A scatterplot of the data is shown in along with two linear fits. The lines follow a negative trend in the data; students who have higher family incomes tended to have lower gift aid from the university.   Gift aid and family income for a random sample of 50 freshman students from Elmhurst College. Two lines are fit to the data, the solid line being the least squares line .   A scatterplot is shown for a random sample of 50 freshman students from Elmhurst College. The horizontal axis is for \"family income\" and has values ranging from $0 to about $300,000. The vertical axis is for \"gift aid\" and has values ranging from $0 to about $35,000. Two lines are fit to the data showing a slight downward trend. One of those lines is a solid line representing what is called the \"least squares line\". About 10 observations are shown where family income is between $0 and $50,000, and gift aid for these values is roughly between $17,000 and $28,000. About 20 observations are shown where family income is between $50,000 and $100,000, and gift aid for these values is roughly between $10,000 and $33,000. About 10 observations are shown where family income is between $100,000 and $150,000, and gift aid for these values is roughly between $9,000 and $25,000. Three observations are shown where family income is between $150,000 and $200,000, and gift aid for these values are $25,000, $12,000, and $13,000. Six more observations are shown where family income is larger than $200,000, and gift aid for these values ranges from about $7,000 to $22,000. The data in this graph will be frequently discussed throughout this section and referred to as the \"Elmhurst data\".      Is the correlation positive or negative in ?    Larger family incomes are associated with lower amounts of aid, so the correlation will be negative. Using a computer, the correlation can be computed: -0.499.      An objective measure for finding the best line  We begin by thinking about what we mean by best . Mathematically, we want a line that has small residuals. The first option that may come to mind is to minimize the sum of the residual magnitudes: which we could accomplish with a computer program. The resulting dashed line shown in demonstrates this fit can be quite reasonable. However, a more common practice is to choose the line that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals:   The line that minimizes this least squares criterion is represented as the solid line in . This is commonly called the least squares line . The following are three possible reasons to choose this option instead of trying to minimize the sum of residual magnitudes without any squaring:  It is the most commonly used method.  Computing the least squares line is widely supported in statistical software.  In many applications, a residual twice as large as another residual is more than twice as bad. For example, being off by 4 is usually more than twice as bad as being off by 2. Squaring the residuals accounts for this discrepancy.  The first two reasons are largely for tradition and convenience; the last reason explains why the least squares criterion is typically most helpful. There are applications where the sum of residual magnitudes may be more useful, and there are plenty of other criteria we might consider. However, this book only applies the least squares criterion.     Conditions for the least squares line  When fitting a least squares line, we generally require     Linearity  The data should show a linear trend. If there is a nonlinear trend (e.g. left panel of ), an advanced regression method from another book or later course should be applied.    Nearly normal residuals  Generally, the residuals must be nearly normal. When this condition is found to be unreasonable, it is usually because of outliers or concerns about influential points, which we'll talk about more in . An example of a residual that would be a potential concern is shown in , where one observation is clearly much further from the regression line than the others.    Constant variability  The variability of points around the least squares line remains roughly constant. An example of non-constant variability is shown in the third panel of , which represents the most common pattern observed when this condition fails: the variability of is larger when is larger.    Independent observations  Be cautious about applying regression to time series data, which are sequential observations in time such as a stock price each day. Such data may have an underlying structure that should be considered in a model and analysis. An example of a data set where successive observations are not independent is shown in the fourth panel of . There are also other instances where correlations within the data are important, which is further discussed in Chapter 9.      Four examples showing when the methods in this chapter are insufficient to apply to the data. First panel: linearity fails. Second panel: there are outliers, most especially one point that is very far away from the line. Third panel: the variability of the errors is related to the value of . Fourth panel: a time series data set is shown, where successive observations are highly correlated.   Four scatterplots are shown, each with their own residual plot. These four examples show when methods in this chapter are insufficient to apply to the data. In the first set, a scatterplot with arch-shaped data is shown with a straight line fit to the data, which poorly fits the curved nature of the data; this is meant to highlight an example where \"linearity\" fails. In the second set, a set of data with a line fit is shown, where the data tightly pack around the line, except one point in particular that is far from the line and represents the case where there are \"extreme outliers\" in the data. The third set shows a case where a straight line fits the data, but the variability around the line changes, where observations tend to be quite close to the line on the left, but when looking further right, the observations tend to be increasingly far from the line, indicating \"changing variability\" in the residuals over different regions of the plot. The fourth set provides another case of what is called \"time series\" data, which is a context where \"successive observations are correlated\".      Should we have concerns about applying least squares regression to the Elmhurst data in ?    The trend appears to be linear, the data fall around the line with no obvious outliers, the variance is roughly constant. These are also not time series observations. Least squares regression can be applied to these data.      Finding the least squares line  For the Elmhurst data, we could write the equation of the least squares regression line as Here the equation is set up to predict gift aid based on a student's family income, which would be useful to students considering Elmhurst. These two values, and , are the parameters of the regression line.  As in Chapters 4, 5, and 6, the parameters are estimated using observed data. In practice, this estimation is done using a computer in the same way that other estimates, like a sample mean, can be estimated using a computer or calculator. However, we can also find the parameter estimates by applying two properties of the least squares line:   The slope of the least squares line can be estimated by where is the correlation between the two variables, and and are the sample standard deviations of the explanatory variable and response, respectively.    If is the sample mean of the explanatory variable and is the sample mean of the vertical variable, then the point is on the least squares line.  shows the sample means for the family income and gift aid as $101,780 and $19,940, respectively. We could plot the point (101.8, 19.94) on to verify it falls on the least squares line (the solid line).   Next, we formally find the point estimates and of the parameters and .   Summary statistics for family income and gift aid.     Family Income ( )  Gift Aid ( )    mean      sd             Using the summary statistics in , compute the slope for the regression line of gift aid against family income.    Compute the slope using the summary statistics from :     You might recall the point-slope form of a line from math class, which we can use to find the model fit, including the estimate of . Given the slope of a line and a point on the line, , the equation for the line can be written as    Identifying the least squares line from summary statistics  To identify the least squares line from summary statistics:  Estimate the slope parameter, .  Noting that the point is on the least squares line, use and with the point-slope equation: .  Simplify the equation, which would reveal that .       Using the point (101780, 19940) from the sample means and the slope estimate from , find the least-squares line for predicting aid based on family income.    Apply the point-slope equation using (101.78, 19.94) and the slope : Expanding the right side and then adding 19,940 to each side, the equation simplifies: Here we have replaced with and with family_income to put the equation in context. The final equation should always include a hat on the variable being predicted, whether it is a generic or a named variable like .    A computer is usually used to compute the least squares line, and a summary table generated using software for the Elmhurst regression line is shown in . The first column of numbers provides estimates for and , respectively. These results match those from (with some minor rounding error).   Summary of least squares fit for the Elmhurst data. Compare the parameter estimates in the first column to the results of .     Estimate  Std. Error  t value  Pr( t )    (Intercept)  24319.3  1291.5  18.83  0.0001    family_income  -0.0431  0.0108  -3.98  0.0002       Examine the second, third, and fourth columns in . Can you guess what they represent? (If you have not reviewed any inference chapter yet, skip this example.)    We'll describe the meaning of the columns using the second row, which corresponds to . The first column provides the point estimate for , as we calculated in an earlier example: . The second column is a standard error for this point estimate: . The third column is a -test statistic for the null hypothesis that : . The last column is the p-value for the -test statistic for the null hypothesis and a two-sided alternative hypothesis: 0.0002. We will get into more of these details in .      Suppose a high school senior is considering Elmhurst College. Can she simply use the linear equation that we have estimated to calculate her financial aid from the university?    She may use it as an estimate, though some qualifiers on this approach are important. First, the data all come from one freshman class, and the way aid is determined by the university may change from year to year. Second, the equation will provide an imperfect estimate. While the linear equation is good at capturing the trend in the data, no individual student's aid will be perfectly predicted.      Interpreting regression model parameter estimates  Interpreting parameters in a regression model is often one of the most important steps in the analysis.    The intercept and slope estimates for the Elmhurst data are and . What do these numbers really mean?    Interpreting the slope parameter is helpful in almost any application. For each additional $1,000 of family income, we would expect a student to receive a net difference of in aid on average, i.e. $43.10 less . Note that a higher family income corresponds to less aid because the coefficient of family income is negative in the model. We must be cautious in this interpretation: while there is a real association, we cannot interpret a causal connection between the variables because these data are observational. That is, increasing a student's family income may not cause the student's aid to drop. (It would be reasonable to contact the college and ask if the relationship is causal, i.e. if Elmhurst College's aid decisions are partially based on students' family income.)  The estimated intercept describes the average aid if a student's family had no income. The meaning of the intercept is relevant to this application since the family income for some students at Elmhurst is $0. In other applications, the intercept may have little or no practical value if there are no observations where is near zero.     Interpreting parameters estimated by least squares  The slope describes the estimated difference in the variable if the explanatory variable for a case happened to be one unit larger. The intercept describes the average outcome of if  and the linear model is valid all the way to , which in many applications is not the case.     Extrapolation is treacherous    When those blizzards hit the East Coast this winter, it proved to my satisfaction that global warming was a fraud. That snow was freezing cold. But in an alarming trend, temperatures this spring have risen. Consider this: On February 6th it was 10 degrees. Today it hit almost 80. At this rate, by August it will be 220 degrees. So clearly folks the climate debate rages on.   Stephen Colbert, April 6th, 2010 www.cc.com\/video-clips\/l4nkoq   Linear models can be used to approximate the relationship between two variables. However, these models have real limitations. Linear regression is simply a modeling framework. The truth is almost always much more complex than our simple line. For example, we do not know how the data outside of our limited window will behave.    Use the model to estimate the aid of another freshman student whose family had income of $1 million.    We want to calculate the aid for : The model predicts this student will have -$18,781 in aid (!). However, Elmhurst College does not offer negative aid where they select some students to pay extra on top of tuition to attend.    Applying a model estimate to values outside of the realm of the original data is called extrapolation . Generally, a linear model is only an approximation of the real relationship between two variables. If we extrapolate, we are making an unreliable bet that the approximate linear relationship will be valid in places where it has not been analyzed.    Using to describe the strength of a fit  We evaluated the strength of the linear relationship between two variables earlier using the correlation, . However, it is more common to explain the strength of a linear fit using , called R-squared . If provided with a linear model, we might like to describe how closely the data cluster around the linear fit.   Gift aid and family income for a random sample of 50 freshman students from Elmhurst College, shown with the least squares regression line.   A scatterplot of the Elmhurst data is shown for gift aid and family income with the least squares regression line overlaid against the data, which has a slight downward trend.    The of a linear model describes the amount of variation in the response that is explained by the least squares line. For example, consider the Elmhurst data, shown in . The variance of the response variable, aid received, is about million. However, if we apply our least squares line, then this model reduces our uncertainty in predicting aid using a student's family income. The variability in the residuals describes how much variation remains after using the model: million. In short, there was a reduction of or about 25% in the data's variation by using information about family income for predicting aid using a linear model. This corresponds exactly to the R-squared value:     If a linear model has a very strong negative relationship with a correlation of -0.97, how much of the variation in the response is explained by the explanatory variable?    About or 94% of the variation is explained by the linear model.      Categorical predictors with two levels  Categorical variables are also useful in predicting outcomes. Here we consider a categorical predictor with two levels (recall that a level is the same as a category ). We'll consider Ebay auctions for a video game, Mario Kart for the Nintendo Wii, where both the total price of the auction and the condition of the game were recorded. Here we want to predict total price based on game condition, which takes values used and new . A plot of the auction data is shown in .   Total auction prices for the video game Mario Kart , divided into used ( ) and new ( ) condition games. The least squares regression line is also shown.   A scatterplot is shown for total auction prices for the video game \"Mario Kart\", broken down by condition on the horizontal axis. The prices are divided into \"used\" and \"new\" condition groups. All used games are shown with an x-value of 0 on the left, and all new games are shown with an x-value of 1 on the right of the plot. The used games on the left show a lower average price of about $43, and new games on the right show a higher average price of about $54. The least squares regression line is also shown for this scatterplot, which shows an upward trend and has a formula of \"price equals 42.87 plus 10.90 times cond-subscript-new.    To incorporate the game condition variable into a regression equation, we must convert the categories into a numerical form. We will do so using an indicator variable called cond_new , which takes value 1 when the game is new and 0 when the game is used. Using this indicator variable, the linear model may be written as The parameter estimates are given in , and the model equation can be summarized as For categorical predictors with just two levels, the linearity assumption will always be satisfied. However, we must evaluate whether the residuals in each group are approximately normal and have approximately equal variance. As can be seen in , both of these conditions are reasonably satisfied by the auction data.   Least squares regression summary for the final auction price against the condition of the game.     Estimate  Std. Error  t value  Pr( t )    (Intercept)  42.87  0.81  52.67  0.0001    cond_new  10.90  1.26  8.66  0.0001       Interpret the two parameters estimated in the model for the price of Mario Kart in eBay auctions.    The intercept is the estimated price when cond_new takes value 0, i.e. when the game is in used condition. That is, the average selling price of a used version of the game is $42.87.  The slope indicates that, on average, new games sell for about $10.90 more than used games.     Interpreting model estimates for categorical predictors  The estimated intercept is the value of the response variable for the first category (i.e. the category corresponding to an indicator value of 0). The estimated slope is the average change in the response variable between the two categories.   We'll elaborate further on this topic in Chapter 9, where we examine the influence of many predictor variables simultaneously using multiple regression.    Exercises     Units of regression. Consider a regression predicting weight (kg) from height (cm) for a sample of adult males. What are the units of the correlation coefficient, the intercept, and the slope?       Which is higher. Determine if I or II is higher or if they are equal. Explain your reasoning. For a regression line, the uncertainty associated with the slope estimate, , is higher when    there is a lot of scatter around the regression line or  there is very little scatter around the regression line         Over-under, Part I. Suppose we fit a regression line to predict the shelf life of an apple based on its weight. For a particular apple, we predict the shelf life to be 4.6 days. The apple's residual is -0.6 days. Did we over or under estimate the shelf-life of the apple? Explain your reasoning.       Over-under, Part II. Suppose we fit a regression line to predict the number of incidents of skin cancer per 1,000 people from the number of sunny days in a year. For a particular year, we predict the incidence of skin cancer to be 1.5 per 1,000 people, and the residual for this year is 0.5. Did we over or under estimate the incidence of skin cancer? Explain your reasoning.       Tourism spending. The Association of Turkish Travel Agencies reports the number of foreign tourists visiting Turkey and tourist spending by year. Three plots are provided: scatterplot showing the relationship between these two variables along with the least squares fit, residuals plot, and histogram of residuals.    A scatterplot with a least squares regression line is fit based on about 50 points. The horizontal axis represents \"Number of tourists\" and has values ranging from about 0 to about 27 million. The vertical axis represents \"Spending, in US dollars\", with values ranging from about $0 to about $17 billion. There are many points shown with the number of tourists between 0 and 5 million, which has spending between about $0 and $3 billion, where even on this small scale a roughly linear trend is evident. The linear trend continues on across the plot and is quite strong -- where residuals generally do not deviate from the least square line by more than very roughly $1 billion. The data are also more sparse for larger values in the plot. There is one region in the center of the plot where about 10 points in a row lie above the regression line. Also consider the next two plots before answering any questions for this exercise.    A residual plot is shown. The horizontal axis represents \"Number of tourists\" and has values ranging from about 0 to about 27 million. Residuals are shown on the vertical axis and have values ranging from about -$1.5 billion to about $1.2 billion. The points on the far left between 0 and 3 million tourists shows a \"v\" pattern. There are about 15 points with number of tourists between 3 million and 10 million, which shows an slight upward trend from about -$700 million to $1.2 billion. There about 10 points with number of tourists greater than 10 million up to about 27 million, and these show a slight downward trend from about $1 billion to -$1.5 billion.    A histogram is shown for the residuals, which shows a roughly bell-shaped distribution centered at 0 and a standard deviation of about $500 million.      Describe the relationship between number of tourists and spending.  What are the explanatory and response variables?  Why might we want to fit a regression line to these data?  Do the data meet the conditions required for fitting a least squares line? In addition to the scatterplot, use the residual plot and histogram to answer this question.         Nutrition at Starbucks, Part I. The scatterplot below shows the relationship between the number of calories and amount of carbohydrates (in grams) Starbucks food menu items contain. Since Starbucks only lists the number of calories on the display items, we are interested in predicting the amount of carbs a menu item has based on its calorie content.    A scatterplot is shown with about 75 points and an overlaid regression line that trends upward. The horizontal axis represents \"Calories\" and has values ranging from about 100 to 500. The vertical axis represents \"Carbs, in grams\" and has values ranging from about 20 to 80. About 15 points are shown with fewer than 200 calories, and these have between about 18 and 25 grams of carbs. About 30 points are shown with 200 to 400 calories, and these mostly have between 30 and 60 grams of carbs. About 20 points are shown with more than 400 calories, and these mostly have between 35 and 80 grams of carbs.    A residual plot is shown with about 75 points. The horizontal axis represents \"Calories\" and has values ranging from about 100 to 500. The vertical axis represents \"Residuals\" and has values ranging from about -30 to 30. About 15 points are shown with fewer than 200 calories, and these have residuals roughly between -7 and positive 2. About 30 points are shown with 200 to 400 calories, and these residuals largely range from about -15 to positive 15. About 20 points are shown with more than 400 calories, and the residuals for these points mostly range between -20 and positive 20.    A histogram is shown for the residuals, which shows a roughly bell-shaped distribution centered at 0 and a standard deviation of about 10.      Describe the relationship between number of calories and amount of carbohydrates (in grams) that Starbucks food menu items contain.  In this scenario, what are the explanatory and response variables?  Why might we want to fit a regression line to these data?  Do these data meet the conditions required for fitting a least squares line?         The Coast Starlight, Part II. An earlier exercise introduces data on the Coast Starlight Amtrak train that runs from Seattle to Los Angeles. The mean travel time from one stop to the next on the Coast Starlight is 129 minutes, with a standard deviation of 113 minutes. The mean distance traveled from one stop to the next is 108 miles with a standard deviation of 99 miles. The correlation between travel time and distance is 0.636.    Write the equation of the regression line for predicting travel time.  Interpret the slope and the intercept in this context.  Calculate of the regression line for predicting travel time from distance traveled for the Coast Starlight, and interpret in the context of the application.  The distance between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles is 103 miles. Use the model to estimate the time it takes for the Starlight to travel between these two cities.  It actually takes the Coast Starlight about 168 minutes to travel from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles. Calculate the residual and explain the meaning of this residual value.  Suppose Amtrak is considering adding a stop to the Coast Starlight 500 miles away from Los Angeles. Would it be appropriate to use this linear model to predict the travel time from Los Angeles to this point?         Body measurements, Part III. An earlier exercise introduces data on shoulder girth and height of a group of individuals. The mean shoulder girth is 107.20 cm with a standard deviation of 10.37 cm. The mean height is 171.14 cm with a standard deviation of 9.41 cm. The correlation between height and shoulder girth is 0.67.    Write the equation of the regression line for predicting height.  Interpret the slope and the intercept in this context.  Calculate of the regression line for predicting height from shoulder girth, and interpret it in the context of the application.  A randomly selected student from your class has a shoulder girth of 100 cm. Predict the height of this student using the model.  The student from part (d) is 160 cm tall. Calculate the residual, and explain what this residual means.  A one-year-old has a shoulder girth of 56 cm. Would it be appropriate to use this linear model to predict the height of this child?         Murders and poverty, Part I. The following regression output is for predicting annual murders per million from percentage living in poverty in a random sample of 20 metropolitan areas.       Estimate  Std.

Interpret .  Calculate the correlation coefficient.      A scatterplot is shown with 20 points. The horizontal axis is \"Percent in Poverty\" and has values ranging from 14% to 26%. The vertical axis is \"Annual Murders per Million\" with values ranging from about 5 to 40. There are 6 points with poverty below 18%, and the Murder Rate for these values ranges from 5 to 13, with one exception of a point at about 17% with a murder rate of about 25. There are 9 points with a poverty rate of 18% to 22%, and the murder rate for these points largely range from 14 to 25, with one exception of a point at about 21% poverty and a murder rate of 35. There are 5 points where poverty is larger than 22%, and these have murder rates ranging from 25 to 40.         Cats, Part I. The following regression output is for predicting the heart weight (in g) of cats from their body weight (in kg). The coefficients are estimated using a dataset of 144 domestic cats.       Estimate  Std. Error  t value  Pr( t )    (Intercept)  -0.357  0.692  -0.515  0.607    body wt  4.034  0.250  16.119  0.000       Write out the linear model.  Interpret the intercept.  Interpret the slope.  Interpret .  Calculate the correlation coefficient.      A scatterplot is shown with about 150 points. The horizontal axis is \"Body weight, in kilograms\" and has values ranging from 2 to 4. The vertical axis is \"Heart weight, in grams\" with values ranging from about 5 to 20. About 25% of the data has a body weight below 2.5 kilograms, and these have heart weights mostly ranging from 7 to 11 grams. About 35% of the data has body weights between 2.5 and 3 kilograms, and the heart weight for these values mostly ranges from 8 to 12 grams. About 30% of the data has body weights between 3 and 3.5 kilograms, and the heart weight for these values mostly ranges from 11 to 15 grams. About 10% of the data has body weights above 3.5 kilograms, and the heart weight for these values mostly ranges from 12 to 17 grams.       "

These four examples show when methods in this chapter are insufficient to apply to the data.

In the second set, a set of data with a line fit is shown, where the data tightly pack around the line, except one point in particular that is far from the line and represents the case where there are \"extreme outliers\" in the data. The third set shows a case where a straight line fits the data, but the variability around the line changes, where observations tend to be quite close to the line on the left, but when looking further right, the observations tend to be increasingly far from the line, indicating \"changing variability\" in the residuals over different regions of the plot. The fourth set provides another case of what is called \"time series\" data, which is a context where \"successive observations are correlated\".   "

Note that a higher family income corresponds to less aid because the coefficient of family income is negative in the model. We must be cautious in this interpretation: while there is a real association, we cannot interpret a causal connection between the variables because these data are observational. That is, increasing a student's family income may not cause the student's aid to drop. (It would be reasonable to contact the college and ask if the relationship is causal, i.e. if Elmhurst College's aid decisions are partially based on students' family income.)  The estimated intercept describes the average aid if a student's family had no income.

  "body": " Types of outliers in linear regression  In this section, we identify criteria for determining which outliers are important and influential. Outliers in regression are observations that fall far from the cloud of points. These points are especially important because they can have a strong influence on the least squares line.    There are six plots shown in along with the least squares line and residual plots. For each scatterplot and residual plot pair, identify the outliers and note how they influence the least squares line. Recall that an outlier is any point that doesn't appear to belong with the vast majority of the other points.       There is one outlier far from the other points, though it only appears to slightly influence the line.    There is one outlier on the right, though it is quite close to the least squares line, which suggests it wasn't very influential.    There is one point far away from the cloud, and this outlier appears to pull the least squares line up on the right; examine how the line around the primary cloud doesn't appear to fit very well.    There is a primary cloud and then a small secondary cloud of four outliers. The secondary cloud appears to be influencing the line somewhat strongly, making the least square line fit poorly almost everywhere. There might be an interesting explanation for the dual clouds, which is something that could be investigated.    There is no obvious trend in the main cloud of points and the outlier on the right appears to largely control the slope of the least squares line.    There is one outlier far from the cloud. However, it falls quite close to the least squares line and does not appear to be very influential.        Six plots, each with a least squares line and residual plot. All data sets have at least one outlier.   Six scatterplots, each with a least squares line and residual plot. All data sets have at least one outlier.

(2) A slight downward trend is evident in the points on the left half of the plot with a regression line overlaying these points and extending to a single point on the far right of the plot that is also very close to the regression line. (3) A positive upward trend is evident for points shown on the left two-thirds of the plot with a regression line overlaying these points, but a single point is shown on the far right and lying substantially above the line. This one point appears to be \"pulling\" the regression line up on the right, making the line fit the rest of the data less well. (4) Most of the data is shown in the left two-thirds of the plot with a clear downward, linear trend. A cluster of 4 points is shown on the far right but deviating notably above the trend of the other points. The regression line fit to the data shows it largely \"trying\" to fit the bulk of the data on the left but being \"pulled\" upward on the right towards the cluster of points deviating from the linear trend. (5) A large cluster of points is shown on the far bottom-left, and there is no apparent trend in this large cluster. A single point is shown on the far upper-right. A regression line is fit to the data with a line extending from the cluster on the bottom-left and trending upwards near the single point on the upper right. (6) A clear downward trend is evident in the points on the right two-thirds of the plot with a regression line overlaying these points and extending to a single point on the far left of the plot that is also very close to the regression line.    Examine the residual plots in . You will probably find that there is some trend in the main clouds of (3) and (4). In these cases, the outliers influenced the slope of the least squares lines. In (5), data with no clear trend were assigned a line with a large trend simply due to one outlier (!).   Leverage  Points that fall horizontally away from the center of the cloud tend to pull harder on the line, so we call them points with high leverage .   Points that fall horizontally far from the line are points of high leverage; these points can strongly influence the slope of the least squares line. If one of these high leverage points does appear to actually invoke its influence on the slope of the line as in cases (3), (4), and (5) of then we call it an influential point . Usually we can say a point is influential if, had we fitted the line without it, the influential point would have been unusually far from the least squares line.  It is tempting to remove outliers. Don't do this without a very good reason. Models that ignore exceptional (and interesting) cases often perform poorly. For instance, if a financial firm ignored the largest market swings the outliers they would soon go bankrupt by making poorly thought-out investments.   Section Exercises   Outliers, Part I   Identify the outliers in the scatterplots shown below, and determine what type of outliers they are. Explain your reasoning.    Most of the data is shown in the left third of the plot with a clear downward, linear trend extending from from the upper-left corner of the plot and to the bottom of the plot only a third of the way from the left side of the plot. A single point is shown on the bottom-right of the plot. A regression line is fit to the data, but it does not fit the bulk of the data well: On the furthest left portion, the line is below the points, crosses over the trend of the bulk of the data, then lies above the remainder of the bulk of the data. If it were shown fully, it would extend well below the single point on the bottom-right.    A clear downward trend is evident in the points on the left third of the plot with a regression line overlaying these points and extending to a single point on the far bottom right of the plot that is also almost exactly on the regression line.    A downward trend is evident in the bulk of the points with an overlaid regression line. A single point is shown far above the regression line at the center-top of the plot.       Outliers, Part II   Identify the outliers in the scatterplots shown below and determine what type of outliers they are. Explain your reasoning.    Most of the data is shown in the right half of the plot with a clear upward, linear trend extending from from the bottom-center and extending to the upper-right corner of the plot. A single point is shown on the upper-left of the plot. A regression line is fit to the data, but it does not fit the bulk of the data well: Focusing first on the bulk of points at the bottom center of the plot, the regression line is well above these points, crosses over the trend of the bulk of the data about 25% from the right of the plot, then lies below the remainder of the bulk of the data in the upper-right. If it were shown fully, the regression line would extend well below the single point on the upper-left.    A clear upward trend is evident in the points on the right half of the plot with a regression line approximately overlaying these points and extending towards a single point on the far bottom left of the plot, but the regression line is notably higher than this single point, which would have by far the largest residual (in absolute value) of all other points shown in the plot. Close inspection of the regression line fit over the bulk of points, it appears to be partially misfitting that data, \"pulled\" down on the left side.    An upper trend is evident in the bulk of the points with an overlaid regression line. A single point is shown far above the regression line at the center-top of the plot.       Urban homeowners, Part I   The scatterplot below shows the percent of families who own their home vs. the percent of the population living in urban areas. There are 52 observations, each corresponding to a state in the US. Puerto Rico and District of Columbia are also included.       Describe the relationship between the percent of families who own their home and the percent of the population living in urban areas.    The outlier at the bottom right corner is District of Columbia, where 100% of the population is considered urban. What type of an outlier is this observation?       A scatterplot is shown with about 50 points. The horizontal axis is for \"Percent Urban Population\" and has values ranging from 40% to 100%. The vertical axis is for \"Percent Own Their Home\" with values ranging from about 40% to about 75%. About 10 points have Urban Population with values smaller than 60%, and these have Homeownership rates between 65% and 75%, with most of those points above 70%. About 20 points have Urban Population with values between 60% and 70%, and these have Homeownership rates between 62% and 75%. About 20 points have Urban Population with values greater than 70%, and these have Homeownership rates between 55% and 73%, with one exception of a point with 100% urban population that has a homeownership rate of about 43%.       Crawling babies, Part II   Exercise introduces data on the average monthly temperature during the month babies first try to crawl (about 6 months after birth) and the average first crawling age for babies born in a given month. A scatterplot of these two variables reveals a potential outlying month when the average temperature is about 53°F and average crawling age is about 28.5 weeks. Does this point have high leverage? Is it an influential point?     "

There is one outlier far from the other points, though it only appears to slightly influence the line.    There is one outlier on the right, though it is quite close to the least squares line, which suggests it wasn't very influential.    There is one point far away from the cloud, and this outlier appears to pull the least squares line up on the right; examine how the line around the primary cloud doesn't appear to fit very well.    There is a primary cloud and then a small secondary cloud of four outliers. The secondary cloud appears to be influencing the line somewhat strongly, making the least square line fit poorly almost everywhere. There might be an interesting explanation for the dual clouds, which is something that could be investigated.    There is no obvious trend in the main cloud of points and the outlier on the right appears to largely control the slope of the least squares line.    There is one outlier far from the cloud. However, it falls quite close to the least squares line and does not appear to be very influential.      "

  "body": " Inference for linear regression   In this section, we discuss uncertainty in the estimates of the slope and y-intercept for a regression line. Just as we identified standard errors for point estimates in previous chapters, we first discuss standard errors for these new estimates.    Midterm elections and unemployment  Elections for members of the United States House of Representatives occur every two years, coinciding every four years with the U.S. Presidential election. The set of House elections occurring during the middle of a Presidential term are called midterm elections . In America's two-party system, one political theory suggests the higher the unemployment rate, the worse the President's party will do in the midterm elections.  To assess the validity of this claim, we can compile historical data and look for a connection. We consider every midterm election from 1898 to 2018, with the exception of those elections during the Great Depression. shows these data and the least-squares regression line: We consider the percent change in the number of seats of the President's party (e.g. percent change in the number of seats for Republicans in 2018) against the unemployment rate.  Examining the data, there are no clear deviations from linearity, the constant variance condition, or substantial outliers. While the data are collected sequentially, a separate analysis was used to check for any apparent correlation between successive observations; no such correlation was found.   The percent change in House seats for the President's party in each midterm election from 1898 to 2018 plotted against the unemployment rate. The two points for the Great Depression have been removed, and a least squares regression line has been fit to the data.   A scatterplot is shown for the percent change in House seats for the President's party in each midterm election from 1898 to 2018 plotted against the unemployment rate. The two points for the Great Depression have been removed, and a least squares regression line has been fit to the data with a slightly downward trend. The horizontal axis is for \"Unemployment Rate\" with values ranging from about 3% to 12%. The vertical axis is for \"Percent Change in Seats of the President's Party in the House of Representatives\" with values ranging from about -30% to positive 10%. The bulk of the observations have Unemployment Rate between 3% and 8%, and these have the percent change in seats ranging from about -27% to positive 4% without any discernible trend. There are four observations with unemployment rate above 8%, and these have the percent change in seats ranging from -25% to -9%. Each point in the scatterplot is also labeled as \"Democrat\" in blue or \"Republican\" in red, though this doesn't reveal any additional pattern.      The data for the Great Depression (1934 and 1938) were removed because the unemployment rate was 21% and 18%, respectively. Do you agree that they should be removed for this investigation? Why or why not?    We will provide two considerations. Each of these points would have very high leverage on any least-squares regression line, and years with such high unemployment may not help us understand what would happen in other years where the unemployment is only modestly high. On the other hand, these are exceptional cases, and we would be discarding important information if we exclude them from a final analysis.    There is a negative slope in the line shown in . However, this slope (and the y-intercept) are only estimates of the parameter values. We might wonder, is this convincing evidence that the true linear model has a negative slope? That is, do the data provide strong evidence that the political theory is accurate, where the unemployment rate is a useful predictor of the midterm election? We can frame this investigation into a statistical hypothesis test:  : . The true linear model has slope zero.  : . The true linear model has a slope different than zero. The unemployment is predictive of whether the President's party wins or loses seats in the House of Representatives.  We would reject in favor of if the data provide strong evidence that the true slope parameter is different than zero. To assess the hypotheses, we identify a standard error for the estimate, compute an appropriate test statistic, and identify the p-value.    Understanding regression output from software  Just like other point estimates we have seen before, we can compute a standard error and test statistic for . We will generally label the test statistic using a , since it follows the -distribution.  We will rely on statistical software to compute the standard error and leave the explanation of how this standard error is determined to a second or third statistics course. shows software output for the least squares regression line in . The row labeled unemp includes the point estimate and other hypothesis test information for the slope, which is the coefficient of the unemployment variable.   Output from statistical software for the regression line modeling the midterm election losses for the President's party as a response to unemployment.     Estimate  Std.

The entries in the first column represent the least squares estimates, and , and the values in the second column correspond to the standard errors of each estimate. Using the estimates, we could write the equation for the least square regression line as where in this case represents the predicted change in the number of seats for the president's party, and represents the unemployment rate.    We previously used a -test statistic for hypothesis testing in the context of numerical data. Regression is very similar. In the hypotheses we consider, the null value for the slope is 0, so we can compute the test statistic using the T (or Z) score formula: This corresponds to the third column of .    Use the table in to determine the p-value for the hypothesis test.    The last column of the table gives the p-value for the two-sided hypothesis test for the coefficient of the unemployment rate: 0.2961. That is, the data do not provide convincing evidence that a higher unemployment rate has any correspondence with smaller or larger losses for the President's party in the House of Representatives in midterm elections.     Inference for regression  We usually rely on statistical software to identify point estimates, standard errors, test statistics, and p-values in practice. However, be aware that software will not generally check whether the method is appropriate, meaning we must still verify conditions are met.     Examine , which relates the Elmhurst College aid and student family income. How sure are you that the slope is statistically significantly different from zero? That is, do you think a formal hypothesis test would reject the claim that the true slope of the line should be zero?    While the relationship between the variables is not perfect, there is an evident decreasing trend in the data. This suggests the hypothesis test will reject the null claim that the slope is zero.       shows statistical software output from fitting the least squares regression line shown in . Use this output to formally evaluate the following hypotheses.  : The true coefficient for family income is zero.  : The true coefficient for family income is not zero.      We look in the second row corresponding to the family income variable. We see the point estimate of the slope of the line is -0.0431, the standard error of this estimate is 0.0108, and the -test statistic is . The p-value corresponds exactly to the two-sided test we are interested in: 0.0002. The p-value is so small that we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that family income and financial aid at Elmhurst College for freshman entering in the year 2011 are negatively correlated and the true slope parameter is indeed less than 0, just as we believed in .

Compute the 95% confidence interval for the family_income coefficient using the regression output from .    The point estimate is -0.0431 and the standard error is . When constructing a confidence interval for a model coefficient, we generally use a -distribution. The degrees of freedom for the distribution are noted in the regression output, , allowing us to identify for use in the confidence interval.  We can now construct the confidence interval in the usual way: We are 95% confident that with each dollar increase in family_income , the university's gift aid is predicted to decrease on average by $0.0214 to $0.0648.     Confidence intervals for coefficients  Confidence intervals for model coefficients can be computed using the -distribution: where is the appropriate -value corresponding to the confidence level with the model's degrees of freedom.   On the topic of intervals in this book, we've focused exclusively on confidence intervals for model parameters. However, there are other types of intervals that may be of interest, including prediction intervals for a response value and also confidence intervals for a mean response value in the context of regression. These two interval types are introduced in an online extra that you may download at www.openintro.org\/d?file=stat_extra_linear_regression_supp     Section Exercises   In the following exercises, visually check the conditions for fitting a least squares regression line. However, you do not need to report these conditions in your solutions.    Body measurements, Part IV   The scatterplot and least squares summary below show the relationship between weight measured in kilograms and height measured in centimeters of 507 physically active individuals.    A scatterplot is shown with around 500 points. The horizontal axis is for \"Height, in centimeters\" and takes values between about 150 to 200 centimeters. The vertical axis is for \"Weight, in kilograms\" and takes values between about 40 to 120 kilograms. For heights smaller than about 160 centimeters, weights mostly range between 45 and 70 kilograms. For heights between 160 and 175 centimeters, weights mostly range between 55 and 80 kilograms. For heights between 175 and 185 centimeters, weights mostly range between 65 and 90 kilograms. For heights between 185 and 195 centimeters, where there are fewer points, weights mostly range between 80 and 95 kilograms. There are two points with heights at about 196cm, and these have weights of about 85 and 95 kilograms.      Estimate  Std.

Write the equation of the regression line. Interpret the slope and intercept in context.  Do the data provide strong evidence that an increase in height is associated with an increase in weight? State the null and alternative hypotheses, report the p-value, and state your conclusion.  The correlation coefficient for height and weight is 0.72. Calculate and interpret it in context.       Beer and blood alcohol content   Many people believe that gender, weight, drinking habits, and many other factors are much more important in predicting blood alcohol content (BAC) than simply considering the number of drinks a person consumed. Here we examine data from sixteen student volunteers at Ohio State University who each drank a randomly assigned number of cans of beer. These students were evenly divided between men and women, and they differed in weight and drinking habits. Thirty minutes later, a police officer measured their blood alcohol content (BAC) in grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood. The scatterplot and regression table summarize the findings.    A scatterplot is shown with around 15 points. The horizontal axis is for \"Cans of beer\" and takes values between about 1 and 9. The vertical axis is for \"Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC), in grams per deciliter\" and takes values between about 0.01 to 0.2. The point at 1 can of beer is at 0.01 BAC, lower than any other values. For the four points at 2 and 3 cans of beer, BAC ranges from 0.02 to 0.07. For the six points at 4 and 5 cans of beer, BAC ranges from 0.05 to 0.10. Two points are at 7 cans of beer and have BAC of 0.09 and 0.10. There is a single point for 8 cans of beer, which has a BAC of 0.12, and one last point at 9 cans of beer, which has a BAC of about 0.19.      Estimate  Std. Error  t value  Pr( |t|)    (Intercept)  -0.0127  0.0126  -1.00  0.3320    beers  0.0180  0.0024  7.48  0.0000       Describe the relationship between the number of cans of beer and BAC.  Write the equation of the regression line. Interpret the slope and intercept in context.  Do the data provide strong evidence that drinking more cans of beer is associated with an increase in blood alcohol? State the null and alternative hypotheses, report the p-value, and state your conclusion.  The correlation coefficient for number of cans of beer and BAC is 0.89. Calculate and interpret it in context.  Suppose we visit a bar, ask people how many drinks they have had, and also take their BAC. Do you think the relationship between number of drinks and BAC would be as strong as the relationship found in the Ohio State study?       Husbands and wives, Part II   The scatterplot below summarizes husbands' and wives' heights in a random sample of 170 married couples in Britain, where both partners' ages are below 65 years. Summary output of the least squares fit for predicting wife's height from husband's height is also provided in the table.    A scatterplot is shown with around 200 points. The horizontal axis is for \"Husband's height, in inches\" and takes values between 60 and 75 inches. The vertical axis is for \"Wife's height, in inches\" and takes values between 55 and 70 inches. For the approximately fifteen husband heights smaller than 65 inches, wife heights are mostly between 59 and 65 inches.

  "body": " Introduction to Multiple Regression   Multiple regression extends simple two-variable regression to the case that still has one response but many predictors (denoted ). The method is motivated by scenarios where many variables may be simultaneously connected to an output.    Indicator and Categorical Variables as Predictors  In multiple regression, we can include both quantitative and categorical variables as predictors. Indicator variables (also called dummy variables) allow us to include categorical information in a linear regression model.  An indicator variable takes a value of 1 when the condition is true and 0 when it is false. For a categorical variable with more than two levels, we create multiple indicator variables, one for each level except one. The omitted level is called the reference level .    Consider a categorical variable such as income verification status with three levels: verified, source only, and not verified. In a regression model, we would create two indicator variables, leaving one level as the reference.      Multiple Regression Equation  The multiple regression model with predictors is: where is the intercept and are the slopes for each predictor.  The interpretation of is: for each one-unit increase in , we expect to increase by units, holding all other predictors constant.    Interpreting Coefficients  The key to interpreting multiple regression coefficients is the phrase holding all other variables constant. This is important because in the real world, variables are often correlated, but multiple regression allows us to isolate the effect of each variable.    In multiple regression, the coefficient for predictor represents the expected change in the response variable for a one-unit increase in , while holding all other predictors constant.     "

However, increases whenever we add a new variable, even if that variable is not truly helpful.     Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of that accounts for the number of predictors in the model: where is the number of observations and is the number of predictors.    Adjusted can decrease if we add a variable that does not improve the model sufficiently to offset the penalty for adding parameters.    Variable Selection Strategies  Several approaches exist for selecting which variables to include in a multiple regression model:     Backward elimination: Start with all variables and remove the least significant one at each step.     Forward selection: Start with no variables and add the most significant one at each step.     Stepwise selection: A combination of forward and backward approaches.

  "body": " Introduction to Logistic Regression   When the response variable is binary (two categories), linear regression is not appropriate because it can produce predicted values outside the range [0, 1]. Logistic regression is designed specifically for binary response variables.    The Logistic Function  The logistic function provides a smooth curve that constrains predictions to be between 0 and 1:   This ensures that predicted probabilities are always between 0 and 1, which is crucial for modeling probabilities.    Odds and Log-Odds    The odds of an event occurring are defined as: where is the probability of the event.    The log-odds (also called the logit) is the natural logarithm of the odds:   The relationship between and the log-odds is linear, which makes logistic regression a natural extension of multiple linear regression.    Interpreting Logistic Regression Coefficients  The coefficient in logistic regression represents the change in log-odds for a one-unit increase in . We can interpret this more intuitively by exponentiating:    The odds ratio is , which represents the multiplicative change in odds for a one-unit increase in .      Inference in Logistic Regression  We can perform hypothesis tests and construct confidence intervals for logistic regression coefficients using the standard error of the estimate. The test statistic follows a normal distribution for large samples.   "

  "body": " Chi-Square Probability Table  A chi-square probability table may be used to find tail areas of a chi-square distribution. When using a chi-square table, we examine a particular row for distributions with different degrees of freedom, and we identify a range for the area (e.g. 0.025 to 0.05). Note that the chi-square table provides upper tail values, which is different than the normal and -distribution tables.
